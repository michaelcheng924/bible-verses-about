 <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  <strong>11</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.  <strong>12</strong> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"6161d9fe264885b83adf930a","topicId":"6161d9fc264885b83adf9303","verse":"Acts 2:38","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p44002038_01-7\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.

And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.  <strong>5</strong> He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:  <strong>6</strong> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that  we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.  <strong>7</strong> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.  <strong>8</strong> And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.  <strong>9</strong> And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?  <strong>10</strong> And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,  <strong>11</strong> Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.  <strong>12</strong> And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.  <strong>13</strong> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.  <strong>14</strong> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.  <strong>15</strong> And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.  <strong>16</strong> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:  <strong>17</strong> For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.  <strong>18</strong> And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.  <strong>20</strong> And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.  <strong>21</strong> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.  <strong>22</strong> And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.  <strong>23</strong> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.  <strong>24</strong> But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.  <strong>25</strong> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.  <strong>26</strong> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  <strong>27</strong> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.  <strong>28</strong> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?  <strong>29</strong> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.  <strong>30</strong> And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.  <strong>31</strong> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.  <strong>32</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:  <strong>33</strong> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.  <strong>34</strong> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.  <strong>35</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.  <strong>36</strong> And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is  in the utmost coast.  <strong>37</strong> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?  <strong>38</strong> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.  <strong>39</strong> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.  <strong>40</strong> And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.  <strong>41</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.

Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, \"This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.\" So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the River, in his native land. Balak said: \"A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Spend the night here,\" Balaam said to them, \"and I will bring you back the answer the LORD gives me.\" So the Moabite princes stayed with him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> God came to Balaam and asked, \"Who are these men with you?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Balaam said to God, \"Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> 'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But God said to Balaam, \"Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's princes, \"Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So the Moabite princes returned to Balak and said, \"Balaam refused to come with us.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They came to Balaam and said: \"This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Balaam answered them, \"Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now stay here tonight as the others did, and I will find out what else the LORD will tell me.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> That night God came to Balaam and said, \"Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat her to get her back on the road. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat her again. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat her with his staff. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, \"What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Balaam answered the donkey, \"You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The donkey said to Balaam, \"Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?No,\" he said. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD asked him, \"Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, \"I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, \"Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.\" So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Balak said to Balaam, \"Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"Well, I have come to you now,\" Balaam replied. \"But can I say just anything? I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the princes who were with him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he saw part of the people.
