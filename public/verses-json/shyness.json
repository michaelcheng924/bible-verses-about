For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.  <strong>10</strong> Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;  <strong>11</strong> Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;  <strong>12</strong> Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;  <strong>13</strong> Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.  <strong>14</strong> Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.  <strong>15</strong> Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.  <strong>16</strong> Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.  <strong>17</strong> Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.  <strong>18</strong> If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.  <strong>19</strong> Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.  <strong>20</strong> Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.  <strong>21</strong> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.  <strong>1</strong> Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.  <strong>2</strong> Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.  <strong>3</strong> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:  <strong>4</strong> For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.  <strong>5</strong> Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.  <strong>6</strong> For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.  <strong>7</strong> Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due;  custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.  <strong>8</strong> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.  <strong>9</strong> For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <strong>10</strong> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.  <strong>11</strong> And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.  <strong>12</strong> The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.  <strong>13</strong> Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.  <strong>14</strong> But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.  <strong>1</strong> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.  <strong>2</strong> For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.  <strong>3</strong> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.  <strong>4</strong> Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.  <strong>5</strong> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.  <strong>6</strong> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.  He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.  <strong>7</strong> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  <strong>8</strong> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.  <strong>9</strong> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.  <strong>10</strong> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  <strong>11</strong> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  <strong>12</strong> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.  <strong>13</strong> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his  brother’s way.  <strong>14</strong> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is  nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.  <strong>15</strong> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  <strong>16</strong> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:  <strong>17</strong> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  <strong>18</strong> For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.  <strong>19</strong> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  <strong>20</strong> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are  pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.  <strong>21</strong> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  <strong>22</strong> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  <strong>23</strong> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth  not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.  <strong>1</strong> We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.  <strong>2</strong> Let every one of us please his neighbour for his  good to edification.  <strong>3</strong> For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.  <strong>4</strong> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.  <strong>5</strong> Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:  <strong>6</strong> That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.  <strong>8</strong> Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:  <strong>9</strong> And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.  <strong>10</strong> And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.  <strong>11</strong> And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.  <strong>12</strong> And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.  <strong>13</strong> Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>14</strong> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.  <strong>15</strong> Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,  <strong>16</strong> That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.  <strong>17</strong> I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.  <strong>18</strong> For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,  <strong>19</strong> Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.  <strong>20</strong> Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man’s foundation:  <strong>21</strong> But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.  <strong>22</strong> For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.  <strong>23</strong> But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;  <strong>24</strong> Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.  <strong>25</strong> But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.  <strong>26</strong> For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.  <strong>27</strong> It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.  <strong>28</strong> When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.  <strong>29</strong> And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.  <strong>30</strong> Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your  prayers to God for me;  <strong>31</strong> That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;  <strong>32</strong> That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.  <strong>33</strong> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.  <strong>1</strong> I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:  <strong>2</strong> That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.  <strong>3</strong> Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:  <strong>4</strong> Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.  <strong>5</strong> Likewise greet the church that is in their house.

Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.  <strong>13</strong> Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.  <strong>14</strong> Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.  <strong>15</strong> Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.  <strong>16</strong> Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.  <strong>17</strong> Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.  <strong>18</strong> For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.  <strong>19</strong> For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.  <strong>20</strong> And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.  <strong>21</strong> Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.  <strong>22</strong> I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.  <strong>23</strong> Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother.  <strong>24</strong> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.  <strong>25</strong> Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,  <strong>26</strong> But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:  <strong>27</strong> To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.

wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  <strong>7</strong> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.  <strong>8</strong> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:  <strong>9</strong> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.  <strong>11</strong> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.  <strong>12</strong> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and  thy wound is grievous.  <strong>13</strong> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.  <strong>14</strong> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.  <strong>15</strong> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.  <strong>17</strong> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.  <strong>18</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.  <strong>19</strong> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.  <strong>20</strong> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.  <strong>21</strong> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  <strong>23</strong> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.  <strong>24</strong> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.  <strong>1</strong> At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.  <strong>3</strong> The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.  <strong>4</strong> Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.  <strong>5</strong> Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.  <strong>6</strong> For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.  <strong>7</strong> For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.  <strong>8</strong> Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.  <strong>9</strong> They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is  my firstborn.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.  <strong>11</strong> For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.  <strong>13</strong> Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.  <strong>14</strong> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.  <strong>15</strong> Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.  <strong>16</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.  <strong>17</strong> And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border.  <strong>18</strong> I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God.  <strong>19</strong> Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.  <strong>20</strong> Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.  <strong>22</strong> How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.  <strong>23</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.  <strong>24</strong> And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.  <strong>25</strong> For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.  <strong>26</strong> Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.  <strong>28</strong> And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.  <strong>29</strong> In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.  <strong>30</strong> But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.  <strong>31</strong> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:  <strong>32</strong> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:  <strong>33</strong> But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.  <strong>34</strong> And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.  <strong>35</strong> Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is his name:  <strong>36</strong> If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then  the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.  <strong>37</strong> Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.  <strong>38</strong> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner.  <strong>39</strong> And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.  <strong>40</strong> And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.  <strong>1</strong> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.  <strong>2</strong> For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah’s house.  <strong>3</strong> For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;  <strong>4</strong> And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;  <strong>5</strong> And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?  <strong>6</strong> And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>7</strong> Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.  <strong>8</strong> So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was  in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.  <strong>10</strong> And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.  <strong>11</strong> So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:  <strong>12</strong> And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s son,  and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.  <strong>13</strong> And I charged Baruch before them, saying,  <strong>14</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.  <strong>15</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.  <strong>16</strong> Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,  <strong>17</strong> Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:  <strong>18</strong> Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,  <strong>19</strong> Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are  open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:  <strong>20</strong> Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even  unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;  <strong>21</strong> And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;  <strong>22</strong> And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;  <strong>23</strong> And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:  <strong>24</strong> Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.  <strong>25</strong> And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.  <strong>26</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>27</strong> Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?  <strong>28</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:  <strong>29</strong> And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.  <strong>30</strong> For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.  <strong>31</strong> For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,  <strong>32</strong> Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  <strong>33</strong> And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.  <strong>34</strong> But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.  <strong>35</strong> And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.  <strong>36</strong> And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;  <strong>37</strong> Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:  <strong>38</strong> And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:  <strong>39</strong> And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:  <strong>40</strong> And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.  <strong>41</strong> Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.  <strong>42</strong> For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.  <strong>43</strong> And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is  desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.  <strong>44</strong> Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name;  <strong>3</strong> Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.  <strong>4</strong> For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword;  <strong>5</strong> They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city.  <strong>6</strong> Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.  <strong>7</strong> And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.  <strong>8</strong> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned, and whereby they have transgressed against me.  <strong>9</strong> And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it.  <strong>10</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even  in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast,  <strong>11</strong> The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.  <strong>12</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.  <strong>13</strong> In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them, saith the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah.  <strong>15</strong> In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.  <strong>16</strong> In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.  <strong>17</strong> For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;  <strong>18</strong> Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.  <strong>19</strong> And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>20</strong> Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their season;  <strong>21</strong> Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.  <strong>22</strong> As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.  <strong>23</strong> Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>24</strong> Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.  <strong>25</strong> Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;  <strong>26</strong> Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.  <strong>1</strong> The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities thereof, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:  <strong>3</strong> And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.  <strong>4</strong> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:  <strong>5</strong> But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.  <strong>6</strong> Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,  <strong>7</strong> When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.  <strong>8</strong>           This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;  <strong>9</strong> That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.  <strong>10</strong> Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.  <strong>11</strong> But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,  <strong>13</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,  <strong>14</strong> At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.  <strong>15</strong> And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:  <strong>16</strong> But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,  <strong>19</strong> The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;  <strong>20</strong> I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.  <strong>21</strong> And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you.  <strong>22</strong> Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.  <strong>1</strong> The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.  <strong>3</strong> Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;  <strong>4</strong> And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:  <strong>5</strong> And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.  <strong>6</strong> But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:  <strong>7</strong> Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers.  <strong>8</strong> Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;  <strong>9</strong> Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:  <strong>10</strong> But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.  <strong>11</strong> But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem.  <strong>12</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>13</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.  <strong>15</strong> I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.  <strong>16</strong> Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:  <strong>17</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.  <strong>18</strong> And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you:  <strong>19</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even into this day.  <strong>3</strong> It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.  <strong>4</strong> Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.  <strong>5</strong> And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:  <strong>6</strong> Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD’S house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.  <strong>7</strong> It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.  <strong>8</strong> And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house.  <strong>9</strong> And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.  <strong>10</strong> Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all the people.  <strong>11</strong> When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,  <strong>12</strong> Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.  <strong>13</strong> Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.  <strong>15</strong> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.  <strong>16</strong> Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.  <strong>17</strong> And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?  <strong>18</strong> Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.  <strong>19</strong> Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.  <strong>20</strong> And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.  <strong>21</strong> So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.  <strong>22</strong> Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.  <strong>24</strong> Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither  the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.  <strong>25</strong> Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.  <strong>26</strong> But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.  <strong>27</strong> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>28</strong> Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.  <strong>29</strong> And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?  <strong>30</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.  <strong>31</strong> And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.  <strong>32</strong> Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.  <strong>1</strong> And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.  <strong>2</strong> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.  <strong>3</strong> And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us.  <strong>4</strong> Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.  <strong>5</strong> Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.  <strong>6</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>7</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.  <strong>8</strong> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.  <strong>9</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.  <strong>10</strong> For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,  <strong>12</strong> Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.  <strong>13</strong> And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.  <strong>14</strong> Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.  <strong>15</strong> Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.  <strong>16</strong> When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;  <strong>17</strong> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.  <strong>18</strong> Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?  <strong>19</strong> Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?  <strong>20</strong> Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.  <strong>21</strong> Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.  <strong>1</strong> Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.  <strong>3</strong> Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.  <strong>4</strong> Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.  <strong>5</strong> Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.  <strong>6</strong> Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.  <strong>7</strong> Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;  <strong>8</strong> Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king, saying,  <strong>9</strong> My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.  <strong>10</strong> Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.  <strong>11</strong> So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.  <strong>12</strong> And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these  old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.  <strong>13</strong> So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.  <strong>14</strong> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.  <strong>15</strong> Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?  <strong>16</strong> So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As  the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.  <strong>17</strong> Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:  <strong>18</strong> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.  <strong>19</strong> And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.  <strong>20</strong> But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.  <strong>21</strong> But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.  <strong>23</strong> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.  <strong>24</strong> Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.  <strong>25</strong> But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:  <strong>26</strong> Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.  <strong>27</strong> Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.  <strong>28</strong> So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.  <strong>1</strong> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.  <strong>2</strong> And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.  <strong>3</strong> And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.  <strong>4</strong> And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.  <strong>5</strong> But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.  <strong>6</strong> Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.  <strong>7</strong> Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.  <strong>8</strong> And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.  <strong>9</strong> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.  <strong>10</strong> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.  <strong>11</strong> Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,  <strong>12</strong> Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.  <strong>13</strong> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;  <strong>14</strong> Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.  <strong>15</strong> Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,  <strong>16</strong> Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.  <strong>17</strong> But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.  <strong>18</strong> For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.  <strong>2</strong> And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.  <strong>3</strong> Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.  <strong>4</strong> And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were  upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.  <strong>5</strong> Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.  <strong>6</strong> Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.  <strong>7</strong> Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;  <strong>8</strong> Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.  <strong>9</strong> And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.  <strong>10</strong> As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.  <strong>11</strong> Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;  <strong>12</strong> Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.  <strong>13</strong> Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,  <strong>14</strong> And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.  <strong>15</strong> Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?  <strong>16</strong> But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.  <strong>1</strong> Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.  <strong>2</strong> Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.  <strong>3</strong> Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and  the men of war.  <strong>4</strong> And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,  <strong>5</strong> That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD.  <strong>6</strong> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.  <strong>7</strong> And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.  <strong>8</strong> But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.  <strong>9</strong> Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.  <strong>10</strong> Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.  <strong>11</strong> But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,  <strong>12</strong> Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.  <strong>13</strong> Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.  <strong>14</strong> So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.  <strong>15</strong> But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.  <strong>16</strong> Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that  he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:  <strong>17</strong> And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,  <strong>18</strong> Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.  <strong>1</strong> Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,  <strong>2</strong> And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:)  <strong>3</strong> That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.  <strong>4</strong> Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you;  behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.  <strong>5</strong> Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.  <strong>6</strong> Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.  <strong>7</strong> And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah.  <strong>8</strong> Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,  <strong>9</strong> And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him;  <strong>10</strong> If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you.  <strong>11</strong> Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.  <strong>12</strong> And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.  <strong>13</strong> But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God,  <strong>14</strong> Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:  <strong>15</strong> And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;  <strong>16</strong> Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.  <strong>17</strong> So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.  <strong>18</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.  <strong>19</strong> The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day.  <strong>20</strong> For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.  <strong>21</strong> And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you.  <strong>22</strong> Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,  <strong>2</strong> Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there:  <strong>3</strong> But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.  <strong>4</strong> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.  <strong>5</strong> But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;  <strong>6</strong> Even men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah.  <strong>7</strong> So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus came they even to Tahpanhes.  <strong>8</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying,  <strong>9</strong> Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;  <strong>10</strong> And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.  <strong>11</strong> And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver  such as are for death to death; and such as are  for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.  <strong>12</strong> And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.  <strong>13</strong> He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.  <strong>1</strong> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,  <strong>3</strong> Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.  <strong>4</strong> Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.  <strong>5</strong> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.  <strong>6</strong> Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain;  <strong>8</strong> In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?  <strong>9</strong> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?  <strong>10</strong> They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.  <strong>12</strong> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.  <strong>13</strong> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:  <strong>14</strong> So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.  <strong>15</strong> Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>16</strong> As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.  <strong>17</strong> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.  <strong>18</strong> But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.  <strong>19</strong> And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?  <strong>20</strong> Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,  <strong>21</strong> The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?  <strong>22</strong> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.  <strong>23</strong> Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.  <strong>24</strong> Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:  <strong>25</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.  <strong>26</strong> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.  <strong>28</strong> Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.  <strong>29</strong> And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:  <strong>30</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.  <strong>1</strong> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;  <strong>3</strong> Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.  <strong>4</strong> Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that  which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.  <strong>5</strong> And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.  <strong>1</strong> The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Gentiles;  <strong>2</strong> Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.  <strong>3</strong> Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.  <strong>4</strong> Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.  <strong>5</strong> Wherefore have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: for fear was round about, saith the LORD.  <strong>6</strong> Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates.  <strong>7</strong> Who is this that cometh up as a flood, whose waters are moved as the rivers?  <strong>8</strong> Egypt riseth up like a flood, and his waters are moved like the rivers; and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.  <strong>9</strong> Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.  <strong>10</strong> For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.  <strong>11</strong> Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for thou shalt not be cured.  <strong>12</strong> The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land: for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, and they are fallen both together.  <strong>13</strong> The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon should come and smite the land of Egypt.  <strong>14</strong> Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.  <strong>15</strong> Why are thy valiant men swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.  <strong>16</strong> He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.  <strong>17</strong> They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.  <strong>18</strong> As I live, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts, Surely as Tabor is among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.  <strong>19</strong> O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant.  <strong>20</strong> Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north.  <strong>21</strong> Also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also are turned back, and are fled away together: they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, and the time of their visitation.  <strong>22</strong> The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.  <strong>23</strong> They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are  innumerable.  <strong>24</strong> The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.  <strong>25</strong> The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and all them that trust in him:  <strong>26</strong> And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.  <strong>28</strong> Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I am  with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.  <strong>1</strong> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza.  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl.  <strong>3</strong> At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses,  at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;  <strong>4</strong> Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, and  to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.  <strong>5</strong> Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?  <strong>6</strong> O thou sword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.  <strong>7</strong> How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.  <strong>1</strong> Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded and taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.  <strong>2</strong> There shall be no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from being  a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.  <strong>3</strong> A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.  <strong>4</strong> Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.  <strong>5</strong> For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.  <strong>6</strong> Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.  <strong>7</strong> For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with  his priests and his princes together.  <strong>8</strong> And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.  <strong>9</strong> Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.  <strong>10</strong> Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.  <strong>11</strong> Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.  <strong>13</strong> And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.  <strong>14</strong> How say ye, We are mighty and strong men for the war?  <strong>15</strong> Moab is spoiled, and gone up out of her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.  <strong>16</strong> The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.  <strong>17</strong> All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, and the beautiful rod!  <strong>18</strong> Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy  glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, and he shall destroy thy strong holds.  <strong>19</strong> O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, and say, What is done?  <strong>20</strong> Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; and tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,  <strong>21</strong> And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,  <strong>22</strong> And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim,  <strong>23</strong> And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon,  <strong>24</strong> And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.  <strong>25</strong> The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.  <strong>26</strong> Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.  <strong>27</strong> For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.  <strong>28</strong> O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.  <strong>29</strong> We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.  <strong>30</strong> I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but it shall not be  so; his lies shall not so effect it.  <strong>31</strong> Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kir-heres.  <strong>32</strong> O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.  <strong>33</strong> And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.  <strong>34</strong> From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even  unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even  unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.  <strong>35</strong> Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the riches that he hath gotten are perished.  <strong>37</strong> For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.  <strong>38</strong> There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.  <strong>39</strong> They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.  <strong>40</strong> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.  <strong>41</strong> Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.  <strong>42</strong> And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.  <strong>43</strong> Fear, and the pit, and the snare, shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.  <strong>44</strong> He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.  <strong>45</strong> They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.  <strong>46</strong> Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.  <strong>47</strong> Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.  <strong>1</strong> Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?  <strong>2</strong> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD.  <strong>3</strong> Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.  <strong>4</strong> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall come unto me?  <strong>5</strong> Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.  <strong>6</strong> And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon, saith the LORD.  <strong>7</strong> Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?  <strong>8</strong> Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit him.  <strong>9</strong> If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some  gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough.  <strong>10</strong> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.  <strong>11</strong> Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me.  <strong>12</strong> For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was  not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.  <strong>13</strong> For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.  <strong>14</strong> I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.  <strong>15</strong> For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised among men.  <strong>16</strong> Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.  <strong>18</strong> As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities  thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.  <strong>19</strong> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?  <strong>20</strong> Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.  <strong>21</strong> The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.  <strong>22</strong> Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.  <strong>23</strong> Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the sea; it cannot be quiet.  <strong>24</strong> Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in travail.  <strong>25</strong> How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!  <strong>26</strong> Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.  <strong>27</strong> And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-hadad.  <strong>28</strong> Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.  <strong>29</strong> Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.  <strong>30</strong> Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.  <strong>31</strong> Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which dwell alone.  <strong>32</strong> And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.  <strong>33</strong> And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.  <strong>34</strong> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,  <strong>35</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.  <strong>36</strong> And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come.  <strong>37</strong> For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them even  my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them, till I have consumed them:  <strong>38</strong> And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king and the princes, saith the LORD.  <strong>39</strong> But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.

 <strong>7</strong> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.  <strong>8</strong> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.  <strong>9</strong> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.  <strong>10</strong> And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;  <strong>11</strong> Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.  <strong>12</strong> Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.  <strong>13</strong> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.  <strong>14</strong> These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.  <strong>15</strong> And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)  <strong>16</strong> Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.  <strong>17</strong> For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.  <strong>18</strong> Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.  <strong>19</strong> And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.  <strong>20</strong> For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.  <strong>21</strong> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,  <strong>22</strong> Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.  <strong>23</strong> And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.  <strong>24</strong> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,  <strong>25</strong> That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.  <strong>26</strong> And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.  <strong>1</strong> And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.  <strong>2</strong> And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.  <strong>3</strong> And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  <strong>4</strong> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.  <strong>5</strong> And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.  <strong>6</strong> Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.  <strong>7</strong> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.  <strong>1</strong> Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.  <strong>2</strong> And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;  <strong>3</strong> Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.  <strong>4</strong> And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.  <strong>5</strong> And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.  <strong>6</strong> Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.  <strong>7</strong> And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.  <strong>8</strong> And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.  <strong>9</strong> And all the people saw him walking and praising God:  <strong>10</strong> And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.  <strong>11</strong> And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.  <strong>12</strong> And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?  <strong>13</strong> The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.  <strong>14</strong> But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;  <strong>15</strong> And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.  <strong>16</strong> And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.  <strong>17</strong> And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it,  as did also your rulers.  <strong>18</strong> But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;  <strong>20</strong> And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:  <strong>21</strong> Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.  <strong>22</strong> For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.  <strong>23</strong> And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.  <strong>24</strong> Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.  <strong>25</strong> Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.  <strong>26</strong> Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.  <strong>1</strong> And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,  <strong>2</strong> Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.  <strong>3</strong> And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.  <strong>4</strong> Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.  <strong>5</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,  <strong>6</strong> And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.  <strong>7</strong> And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?  <strong>8</strong> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,  <strong>9</strong> If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;  <strong>10</strong> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  <strong>11</strong> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.  <strong>12</strong> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  <strong>13</strong> Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.  <strong>14</strong> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  <strong>15</strong> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  <strong>16</strong> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.  <strong>17</strong> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.  <strong>18</strong> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.  <strong>19</strong> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  <strong>20</strong> For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  <strong>21</strong> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men  glorified God for that which was done.  <strong>22</strong> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.  <strong>23</strong> And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.  <strong>24</strong> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:  <strong>25</strong> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?  <strong>26</strong> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.  <strong>27</strong> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,  <strong>28</strong> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.  <strong>29</strong> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,  <strong>30</strong> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.  <strong>31</strong> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.  <strong>32</strong> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.  <strong>33</strong> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.  <strong>34</strong> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,  <strong>35</strong> And laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.  <strong>36</strong> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,  <strong>37</strong> Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.  <strong>1</strong> But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,  <strong>2</strong> And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.  <strong>3</strong> But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?  <strong>4</strong> Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.  <strong>5</strong> And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.  <strong>6</strong> And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.  <strong>7</strong> And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.  <strong>8</strong> And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.  <strong>9</strong> Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.  <strong>10</strong> Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her  forth, buried her by her husband.  <strong>11</strong> And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.  <strong>12</strong> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.  <strong>13</strong> And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.  <strong>14</strong> And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)  <strong>15</strong> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.  <strong>16</strong> There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.  <strong>17</strong> Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,  <strong>18</strong> And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.  <strong>19</strong> But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,  <strong>20</strong> Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.  <strong>21</strong> And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought.  <strong>22</strong> But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,  <strong>23</strong> Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.  <strong>24</strong> Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.  <strong>25</strong> Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.  <strong>26</strong> Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.  <strong>27</strong> And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,  <strong>28</strong> Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.  <strong>29</strong> Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.  <strong>30</strong> The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.  <strong>31</strong> Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.  <strong>32</strong> And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.  <strong>33</strong> When they heard that, they were cut to the heart,  and took counsel to slay them.  <strong>34</strong> Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;  <strong>35</strong> And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.  <strong>36</strong> For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.  <strong>37</strong> After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even  as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.  <strong>38</strong> And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:  <strong>39</strong> But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.  <strong>40</strong> And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.  <strong>41</strong> And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.  <strong>42</strong> And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.  <strong>1</strong> And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.  <strong>2</strong> Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,  and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.  <strong>3</strong> Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.  <strong>4</strong> But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.  <strong>5</strong> And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:  <strong>6</strong> Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.  <strong>7</strong> And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.  <strong>8</strong> And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.  <strong>9</strong> Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.  <strong>10</strong> And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.  <strong>11</strong> Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.  <strong>12</strong> And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,  <strong>13</strong> And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:  <strong>14</strong> For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.  <strong>15</strong> And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.  <strong>1</strong> Then said the high priest, Are these things so?  <strong>2</strong> And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,  <strong>3</strong> And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.  <strong>4</strong> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.  <strong>5</strong> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as  to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.  <strong>6</strong> And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them  evil four hundred years.  <strong>7</strong> And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.  <strong>8</strong> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham  begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat  Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.  <strong>9</strong> And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,  <strong>10</strong> And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.  <strong>11</strong> Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.  <strong>12</strong> But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.  <strong>13</strong> And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.  <strong>14</strong> Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.  <strong>15</strong> So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,  <strong>16</strong> And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father  of Sychem.  <strong>17</strong> But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,  <strong>18</strong> Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.  <strong>19</strong> The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.  <strong>20</strong> In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house three months:  <strong>21</strong> And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.  <strong>22</strong> And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.  <strong>23</strong> And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.  <strong>24</strong> And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him,  and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:  <strong>25</strong> For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.  <strong>26</strong> And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?  <strong>27</strong> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?  <strong>28</strong> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?  <strong>29</strong> Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.  <strong>30</strong> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.  <strong>31</strong> When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,  <strong>32</strong> Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.  <strong>33</strong> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.  <strong>34</strong> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.  <strong>35</strong> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.  <strong>36</strong> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.  <strong>37</strong> This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  <strong>38</strong> This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:  <strong>39</strong> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,  <strong>40</strong> Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for  this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  <strong>41</strong> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.  <strong>42</strong> Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?  <strong>43</strong> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.  <strong>44</strong> Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.  <strong>45</strong> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;  <strong>46</strong> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.  <strong>47</strong> But Solomon built him an house.  <strong>48</strong> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,  <strong>49</strong> Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?  <strong>50</strong> Hath not my hand made all these things?  <strong>51</strong> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.  <strong>52</strong> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:  <strong>53</strong> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.  <strong>54</strong> When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  <strong>55</strong> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,  <strong>56</strong> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.  <strong>57</strong> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,  <strong>58</strong> And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.  <strong>59</strong> And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.  <strong>60</strong> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.  <strong>1</strong> And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.  <strong>2</strong> And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.  <strong>3</strong> As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.  <strong>4</strong> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.  <strong>5</strong> Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.  <strong>6</strong> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.  <strong>7</strong> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.  <strong>8</strong> And there was great joy in that city.  <strong>9</strong> But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:  <strong>10</strong> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.  <strong>11</strong> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.  <strong>12</strong> But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.  <strong>13</strong> Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.  <strong>14</strong> Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:  <strong>15</strong> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:  <strong>16</strong> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)  <strong>17</strong> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.  <strong>18</strong> And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,  <strong>19</strong> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.  <strong>20</strong> But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.  <strong>21</strong> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.  <strong>22</strong> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.  <strong>23</strong> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in  the bond of iniquity.  <strong>24</strong> Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.  <strong>25</strong> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.  <strong>26</strong> And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.  <strong>27</strong> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,  <strong>28</strong> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.  <strong>29</strong> Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.  <strong>30</strong> And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?  <strong>31</strong> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.  <strong>32</strong> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:  <strong>33</strong> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.  <strong>34</strong> And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?  <strong>35</strong> Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.  <strong>36</strong> And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?  <strong>37</strong> And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  <strong>38</strong> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.  <strong>39</strong> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.  <strong>40</strong> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.  <strong>1</strong> And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,  <strong>2</strong> And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.  <strong>3</strong> And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:  <strong>4</strong> And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  <strong>5</strong> And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.  <strong>6</strong> And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.  <strong>7</strong> And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.  <strong>8</strong> And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.  <strong>9</strong> And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.  <strong>10</strong> And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.  <strong>11</strong> And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one  called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,  <strong>12</strong> And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.  <strong>13</strong> Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:  <strong>14</strong> And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.  <strong>15</strong> But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:  <strong>16</strong> For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.  <strong>17</strong> And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>18</strong> And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.  <strong>19</strong> And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.  <strong>20</strong> And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.  <strong>21</strong> But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?  <strong>22</strong> But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.  <strong>23</strong> And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:  <strong>24</strong> But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.  <strong>25</strong> Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.  <strong>26</strong> And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.  <strong>27</strong> But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.  <strong>28</strong> And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.  <strong>29</strong> And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.  <strong>30</strong> Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.  <strong>31</strong> Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.  <strong>32</strong> And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters,  he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.  <strong>33</strong> And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.  <strong>34</strong> And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.  <strong>35</strong> And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.  <strong>36</strong> Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.  <strong>37</strong> And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.  <strong>38</strong> And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him  that he would not delay to come to them.  <strong>39</strong> Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.  <strong>40</strong> But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.  <strong>41</strong> And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.  <strong>42</strong> And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.  <strong>43</strong> And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.  <strong>1</strong> There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,  <strong>2</strong> A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.  <strong>3</strong> He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.  <strong>4</strong> And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  <strong>24</strong> And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.  <strong>25</strong> And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.  <strong>26</strong> But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.  <strong>27</strong> And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.  <strong>28</strong> And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.  <strong>29</strong> Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?  <strong>30</strong> And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,  <strong>31</strong> And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.  <strong>32</strong> Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.  <strong>33</strong> Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  <strong>34</strong> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  <strong>35</strong> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  <strong>36</strong> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  <strong>37</strong> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <strong>38</strong> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  <strong>39</strong> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  <strong>40</strong> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  <strong>41</strong> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  <strong>42</strong> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  <strong>43</strong> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  <strong>44</strong> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  <strong>45</strong> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>46</strong> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  <strong>47</strong> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  <strong>48</strong> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.  <strong>1</strong> And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.  <strong>2</strong> And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,  <strong>3</strong> Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.  <strong>4</strong> But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,  <strong>5</strong> I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:  <strong>6</strong> Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>7</strong> And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.  <strong>8</strong> But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.  <strong>9</strong> But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>10</strong> And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.  <strong>11</strong> And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.  <strong>12</strong> And the spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:  <strong>13</strong> And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;  <strong>14</strong> Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.  <strong>15</strong> And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.  <strong>16</strong> Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>17</strong> Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?  <strong>18</strong> When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.  <strong>19</strong> Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.  <strong>20</strong> And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.  <strong>21</strong> And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.  <strong>22</strong> Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.  <strong>23</strong> Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.  <strong>24</strong> For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.  <strong>25</strong> Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:  <strong>26</strong> And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.  <strong>27</strong> And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.  <strong>28</strong> And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.  <strong>29</strong> Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:  <strong>30</strong> Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.  <strong>1</strong> Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.  <strong>2</strong> And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.  <strong>3</strong> And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)  <strong>4</strong> And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.  <strong>5</strong> Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.  <strong>6</strong> And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.  <strong>7</strong> And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.  <strong>8</strong> And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.  <strong>9</strong> And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.  <strong>10</strong> When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.  <strong>11</strong> And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.  <strong>12</strong> And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.  <strong>13</strong> And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.  <strong>14</strong> And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.  <strong>15</strong> And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.  <strong>16</strong> But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,  and saw him, they were astonished.  <strong>17</strong> But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.  <strong>18</strong> Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.  <strong>19</strong> And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.  <strong>20</strong> And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s country.  <strong>21</strong> And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.  <strong>22</strong> And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.  <strong>23</strong> And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.  <strong>24</strong> But the word of God grew and multiplied.  <strong>25</strong> And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So when they met together, they asked him, \"Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He said to them: \"It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Men of Galilee,\" they said, \"why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city.

Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <strong>2</strong> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I
