The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,\" says the LORD. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, till the last of the Philistines is dead,\" says the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom, disregarding a treaty of brotherhood, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because he pursued his brother with a sword, stifling all compassion, because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will send fire upon Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not turn back {my wrath}. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle, amid violent winds on a stormy day. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Her king will go into exile, he and his officials together,\" says the LORD.
