And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  <strong>7</strong> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.  <strong>8</strong> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.  <strong>9</strong> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.  <strong>10</strong> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.  <strong>11</strong> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  <strong>12</strong> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own? <strong>13</strong>           No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  <strong>14</strong> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.  <strong>15</strong> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.  <strong>16</strong> The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.  <strong>17</strong> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.  <strong>18</strong> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her  husband committeth adultery. <strong>19</strong>           There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:  <strong>20</strong> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,  <strong>21</strong> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.  <strong>22</strong> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;  <strong>23</strong> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.  <strong>24</strong> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.  <strong>25</strong> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.  <strong>26</strong> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.  <strong>27</strong> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:  <strong>28</strong> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.  <strong>29</strong> Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.  <strong>30</strong> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.  <strong>31</strong> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.

Amen.  <strong>26</strong> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  <strong>27</strong> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  <strong>28</strong> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  <strong>29</strong> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  <strong>30</strong> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  <strong>31</strong> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  <strong>32</strong> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
