For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD, they and their descendants with them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain,\" says the LORD.
