to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!  <strong>3</strong> Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.  <strong>4</strong> For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.  <strong>5</strong> They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.  <strong>6</strong> The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that  shall not profit them.  <strong>7</strong> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.  <strong>8</strong> Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:  <strong>9</strong> That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:  <strong>10</strong> Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:  <strong>11</strong> Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:  <strong>13</strong> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.  <strong>14</strong> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.  <strong>15</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.  <strong>16</strong> But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.  <strong>17</strong> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.  <strong>18</strong> And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.  <strong>19</strong> For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.  <strong>20</strong> And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:  <strong>21</strong> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is  the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.  <strong>22</strong> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.  <strong>23</strong> Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.  <strong>24</strong> The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.  <strong>25</strong> And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.  <strong>26</strong> Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with  his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:  <strong>28</strong> And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.  <strong>29</strong> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.  <strong>30</strong> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.  <strong>31</strong> For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.  <strong>32</strong> And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.  <strong>33</strong> For Tophet is ordained of old;

Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Leave this way, get off this path, and stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: \"Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: \"In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You said, 'No, we will flee on horses.' Therefore you will flee! You said, 'We will ride off on swift horses.'

For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, \"This is the way; walk in it.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then you will defile your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, \"Away with you!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful.

He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people go up with flutes to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The LORD will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria; with his scepter he will strike them down. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Every stroke the LORD lays on them with his punishing rod will be to the music of tambourines and harps, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.

Are we stronger than he? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is beneficial. \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is constructive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> for, \"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if anyone says to you, \"This has been offered in sacrifice,\" then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake-- <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God-- <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> even as I try to please everybody in every way.

You oppress the righteous and take bribes and you deprive the poor of justice in the courts. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore the prudent man keeps quiet in such times, for the times are evil. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Seek good, not evil, that you may live.

Perhaps the LORD God Almighty will have mercy on the remnant of Joseph. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the Lord, the LORD God Almighty, says: \"There will be wailing in all the streets and cries of anguish in every public square. The farmers will be summoned to weep and the mourners to wail. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> There will be wailing in all the vineyards, for I will pass through your midst,\" says the LORD. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Woe to you who long for the day of the LORD! Why do you long for the day of the LORD? That day will be darkness, not light. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> It will be as though a man fled from a lion only to meet a bear, as though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall only to have a snake bite him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Will not the day of the LORD be darkness, not light- pitch-dark, without a ray of brightness? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"I hate, I despise your religious feasts; I cannot stand your assemblies. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Though you bring choice fellowship offerings, I will have no regard for them. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Away with the noise of your songs! I will not listen to the music of your harps. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert, O house of Israel? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> You have lifted up the shrine of your king, the pedestal of your idols, the star of your god - which you made for yourselves. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,\" says the LORD, whose name is God Almighty.

Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.  <strong>33</strong> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.  <strong>34</strong> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.  <strong>35</strong> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.  <strong>36</strong> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.  <strong>37</strong> This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  <strong>38</strong> This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:  <strong>39</strong> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,  <strong>40</strong> Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for  this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  <strong>41</strong> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.  <strong>42</strong> Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?  <strong>43</strong> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.  <strong>44</strong> Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.  <strong>45</strong> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;  <strong>46</strong> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.  <strong>47</strong> But Solomon built him an house.  <strong>48</strong> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,  <strong>49</strong> Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?  <strong>50</strong> Hath not my hand made all these things?  <strong>51</strong> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.  <strong>52</strong> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:  <strong>53</strong> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.  <strong>54</strong> When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  <strong>55</strong> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,  <strong>56</strong> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.  <strong>57</strong> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,  <strong>58</strong> And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.  <strong>59</strong> And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.  <strong>60</strong> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the high priest asked him, \"Are these charges true?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> To this he replied: \"Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> 'Leave your country and your people,' God said, 'and go to the land I will show you.' <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> God spoke to him in this way: 'Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt; so he made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our fathers could not find food. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our fathers died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then another king, who knew nothing about Joseph, became ruler of Egypt. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for in his father's house. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 'Who made you ruler and judge over us? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord's voice: <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.' Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He led them out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"This is that Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will send you a prophet like me from your own people.' <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They told Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt--we don't know what has happened to him!' <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hands had made. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> But God turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: \"'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert, O house of Israel? <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> You have lifted up the shrine of Molech and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile' beyond Babylon. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the desert. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Having received the tabernacle, our fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> who enjoyed God's favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> But it was Solomon who built the house for him. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"However, the Most High does not live in houses made by men. As the prophet says: <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be? <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Has not my hand made all these things?' <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him-- <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> \"Look,\" he said, \"I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\" <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then he fell on his knees and cried out, \"Lord, do not hold this sin against them.\" When he had said this, he fell asleep.
