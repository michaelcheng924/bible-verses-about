The Lord is near. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me--put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I can do everything through him who gives me strength. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid again and again when I was in need. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Not that I am looking for a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send greetings. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
