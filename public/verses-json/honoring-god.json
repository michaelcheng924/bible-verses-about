Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen: to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter- when you see the naked, to clothe him, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I. \"If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD's holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob.\" The mouth of the LORD has spoken.
