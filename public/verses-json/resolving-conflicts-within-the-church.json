Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus.

He said to Abraham, 'Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways.\" "}]}
