And the king said, What wouldest thou?  <strong>17</strong> And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.  <strong>18</strong> And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:  <strong>19</strong> And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.  <strong>20</strong> And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.  <strong>21</strong> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.  <strong>22</strong> And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.  <strong>23</strong> And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet.

And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?  <strong>42</strong> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.  <strong>43</strong> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.  <strong>44</strong> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:  <strong>45</strong> And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.  <strong>46</strong> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.  <strong>47</strong> And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.  <strong>48</strong> And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.  <strong>49</strong> And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.  <strong>50</strong> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <strong>51</strong> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.  <strong>52</strong> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.  <strong>53</strong> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When King David was old and well advanced in years, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So his servants said to him, \"Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, \"I will be king.\" So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> (His father had never interfered with him by asking, \"Why do you behave as you do?\" He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.) <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David's special guard did not join Adonijah. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah who were royal officials, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, \"Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David's knowing it? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Go in to King David and say to him, 'My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant: \"Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne\"? Why then has Adonijah become king?' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and confirm what you have said.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. \"What is it you want?\" the king asked. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She said to him, \"My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God: 'Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And they told the king, \"Nathan the prophet is here.\" So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Nathan said, \"Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then King David said, \"Call in Bathsheba.\" So she came into the king's presence and stood before him. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The king then took an oath: \"As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel: Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and, kneeling before the king, said, \"May my lord King David live forever!\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> King David said, \"Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.\" When they came before the king, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> he said to them: \"Take your lord's servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, \"Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, \"Long live King Solomon!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, \"What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, \"Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Not at all!\" Jonathan answered. \"Our lord King David has made Solomon king. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> and said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Then Solomon was told, \"Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Solomon replied, \"If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar.

Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11002041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11002042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the LORD and solemnly warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die’?

And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.  <strong>14</strong> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.  <strong>15</strong> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that  all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.  <strong>18</strong> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.  <strong>19</strong> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.  <strong>20</strong> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,  say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  <strong>21</strong> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  <strong>22</strong> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  <strong>23</strong> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.  <strong>24</strong> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.  <strong>25</strong> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.  <strong>26</strong> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.  <strong>27</strong> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  <strong>28</strong> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <strong>29</strong> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.  <strong>30</strong> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.  <strong>31</strong> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.  <strong>32</strong> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.  <strong>33</strong> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.  <strong>34</strong> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  <strong>35</strong> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.  <strong>36</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.  <strong>37</strong> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.  <strong>38</strong> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.  <strong>39</strong> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.  <strong>40</strong> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  <strong>41</strong> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  <strong>42</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.  <strong>43</strong> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?  <strong>44</strong> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  <strong>45</strong> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.  <strong>46</strong> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"I am about to go the way of all the earth,\" he said. \"So be strong, show yourself a man, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.' <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me-what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.' <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He had reigned forty years over Israel-seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, \"Do you come peacefully?\" He answered, \"Yes, peacefully.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he added, \"I have something to say to you.You may say it,\" she replied. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"As you know,\" he said, \"the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.You may make it,\" she said. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he continued, \"Please ask King Solomon-he will not refuse you-to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Very well,\" Bathsheba replied, \"I will speak to the king for you.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have one small request to make of you,\" she said. \"Do not refuse me.\" The king replied, \"Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So she said, \"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> King Solomon answered his mother, \"Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him-after all, he is my older brother-yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request! <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And now, as surely as the LORD lives-he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised-Adonijah shall be put to death today!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> To Abiathar the priest the king said, \"Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, \"Go, strike him down!\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, \"The king says, 'Come out!'\" But he answered, \"No, I will die here.\" Benaiah reported to the king, \"This is how Joab answered me.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then the king commanded Benaiah, \"Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them-Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army-were better men and more upright than he. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD's peace forever.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land in the desert. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Shimei answered the king, \"What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.\" And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, \"Your slaves are in Gath.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> the king summoned Shimei and said to him, \"Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.' <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The king also said to Shimei, \"You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wrongdoing. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and killed him. The kingdom was now firmly established in Solomon's hands.

And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <strong>4</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <strong>6</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <strong>7</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.  <strong>8</strong> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.  <strong>10</strong> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.  <strong>11</strong> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:  <strong>12</strong> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.  <strong>13</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art  thou?

And he smote him that he died.  <strong>16</strong> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.  <strong>17</strong> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  <strong>18</strong> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of  the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  <strong>19</strong> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <strong>20</strong> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <strong>21</strong> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.  <strong>22</strong> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  <strong>23</strong> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.  <strong>24</strong> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  <strong>25</strong> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  <strong>26</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <strong>27</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me.

Don't kill him!\" But the other said, \"Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the king gave his ruling: \"Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.

So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"61592e41cd920c662d000327","topicId":"61592e3ccd920c662d000319","verse":"2 Kings 1:1-18","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p12001001_04-20\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v12001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.</p>\n<p id=\"p12001001_04-20\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v12001002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, “Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v12001003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v12001004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’” So Elijah went.</p>\n<p id=\"p12001004_04-20\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v12001005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, “Why have you returned?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v12001006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, “There came a man to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?

But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.

This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

But to those who do not believe, \"The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, \" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and, \"A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.\" They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
