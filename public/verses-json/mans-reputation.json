","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of every man; the living should take this to heart. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Do not say, \"Why were the old days better than these?\" For it is not wise to ask such questions. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this: that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Consider what God has done: Who can straighten what he has made crooked? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider: God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these: a righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise- why destroy yourself? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool- why die before your time? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears God will avoid all extremes. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you- <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> All this I tested by wisdom and I said, \"I am determined to be wise\"- but this was beyond me. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Whatever wisdom may be, it is far off and most profound- who can discover it? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Look,\" says the Teacher, \"this is what I have discovered: \"Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things- <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> while I was still searching but not finding- I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.
