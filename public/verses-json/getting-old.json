A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Not at all!\" Jonathan answered. \"Our lord King David has made Solomon king. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> and said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Then Solomon was told, \"Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Solomon replied, \"If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, \"Go to your home.\" "}]}
