And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  <strong>2</strong> And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:  <strong>3</strong> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  <strong>4</strong> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  <strong>5</strong> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  <strong>6</strong> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.  <strong>7</strong> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.  <strong>8</strong> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art  thou?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.  <strong>11</strong> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?  <strong>12</strong> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  <strong>13</strong> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that  thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  <strong>15</strong> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  <strong>16</strong> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  <strong>17</strong> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;  <strong>18</strong> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;  <strong>19</strong> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  <strong>20</strong> And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.  <strong>21</strong> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  <strong>22</strong> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  <strong>23</strong> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  <strong>24</strong> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, \"Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The woman said to the serpent, \"We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"You will not surely die,\" the serpent said to the woman. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But the LORD God called to the man, \"Where are you?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He answered, \"I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And he said, \"Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The man said, \"The woman you put here with me-she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then the LORD God said to the woman, \"What is this you have done?\" The woman said, \"The serpent deceived me, and I ate.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So the LORD God said to the serpent, \"Because you have done this, \"Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> To the woman he said, \"I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> To Adam he said, \"Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,'\"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
