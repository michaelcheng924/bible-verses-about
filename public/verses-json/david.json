am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.  <strong>9</strong> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.  <strong>10</strong> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.  <strong>11</strong> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  <strong>12</strong> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.  <strong>13</strong> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <strong>14</strong> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.  <strong>15</strong> But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.  <strong>16</strong> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;  <strong>18</strong> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.  <strong>19</strong> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.  <strong>20</strong> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.  <strong>21</strong> For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.  <strong>22</strong> And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.  <strong>23</strong> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.  <strong>24</strong> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.  <strong>25</strong> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.  <strong>26</strong> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?  <strong>27</strong> And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.  <strong>28</strong> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.  <strong>29</strong> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?  <strong>30</strong> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.  <strong>31</strong> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.  <strong>32</strong> And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.  <strong>33</strong> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.  <strong>34</strong> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:  <strong>35</strong> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it  out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him  by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.  <strong>36</strong> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.  <strong>37</strong> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.  <strong>39</strong> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.  <strong>40</strong> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.  <strong>41</strong> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.  <strong>42</strong> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.  <strong>43</strong> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <strong>44</strong> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.  <strong>45</strong> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.  <strong>46</strong> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.  <strong>47</strong> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.  <strong>48</strong> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  <strong>49</strong> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.  <strong>50</strong> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.  <strong>51</strong> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.  <strong>52</strong> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.  <strong>53</strong> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.  <strong>54</strong> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.  <strong>55</strong> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.  <strong>56</strong> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.  <strong>57</strong> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  <strong>58</strong> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou  young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, \"Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the Philistine said, \"This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now Jesse said to his son David, \"Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now the Israelites had been saying, \"Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> David asked the men standing near him, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, \"This is what will be done for the man who kills him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, \"Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Now what have I done?\" said David. \"Can't I even speak?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Saul, \"Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" Saul said to David, \"Go, and the LORD be with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. \"I cannot go in these,\" he said to Saul, \"because I am not used to them.\" So he took them off. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Come here,\" he said, \"and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> David said to the Philistine, \"You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is that young man?\" Abner replied, \"As surely as you live, O king, I don't know.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The king said, \"Find out whose son this young man is.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"Whose son are you, young man?\" Saul asked him. David said, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.\" "},{"_id":"615cfea3e4f8ad1e13fa8597","topicId":"615cfe9fe4f8ad1e13fa858d","verse":"1 Samuel 13:13-14","votes":12,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p09013013_01-14\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09013013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly.

come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.  <strong>3</strong> I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.  <strong>4</strong> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.  <strong>5</strong> O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.  <strong>6</strong> Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.  <strong>8</strong> I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.  <strong>9</strong> For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.  <strong>10</strong> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.  <strong>11</strong> I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.  <strong>12</strong> They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.  <strong>13</strong> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in  an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.  <strong>14</strong> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.  <strong>15</strong> Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.  <strong>16</strong> Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.  <strong>17</strong> And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.  <strong>18</strong> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.  <strong>19</strong> Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.  <strong>20</strong> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.  <strong>21</strong> They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.  <strong>22</strong> Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.  <strong>23</strong> Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.  <strong>24</strong> Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.  <strong>25</strong> Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.  <strong>26</strong> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.  <strong>27</strong> Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.  <strong>28</strong> Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.  <strong>29</strong> But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.  <strong>30</strong> I will praise the name of God with a song, and will

seas, and every thing that moveth therein.  <strong>35</strong> For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.  <strong>36</strong>

And they went out both of them into the field.  <strong>12</strong> And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day,  and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;  <strong>13</strong> The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.  <strong>14</strong> And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:  <strong>15</strong> But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.  <strong>16</strong> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.  <strong>17</strong> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.  <strong>18</strong> Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.  <strong>19</strong> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.  <strong>20</strong> And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.  <strong>21</strong> And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.  <strong>22</strong> But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are  beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.  <strong>23</strong> And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.  <strong>24</strong> So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.  <strong>25</strong> And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.  <strong>26</strong> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?  <strong>28</strong> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:  <strong>29</strong> And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.  <strong>30</strong> Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?  <strong>31</strong> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.  <strong>32</strong> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?  <strong>33</strong> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.  <strong>34</strong> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.  <strong>35</strong> And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.  <strong>36</strong> And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.  <strong>37</strong> And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?  <strong>38</strong> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.  <strong>39</strong> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.  <strong>40</strong> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.  <strong>41</strong>           And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.  <strong>42</strong> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, \"What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Never!\" Jonathan replied. \"You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But David took an oath and said, \"Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jonathan said to David, \"Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So David said, \"Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If your father misses me at all, tell him, 'David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> If he says, 'Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Never!\" Jonathan said. \"If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> David asked, \"Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Come,\" Jonathan said, \"let's go out into the field.\" So they went there together. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then Jonathan said to David: \"By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family-not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \"May the LORD call David's enemies to account.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then Jonathan said to David: \"Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then I will send a boy and say, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And about the matter you and I discussed-remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, \"Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean-surely he is unclean.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, \"Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Jonathan answered, \"David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He said, 'Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, \"You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?\" Jonathan asked his father. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> and he said to the boy, \"Run and find the arrows I shoot.\" As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, \"Isn't the arrow beyond you?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then he shouted, \"Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!\" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> (The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.) <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, \"Go, carry them back to town.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together-but David wept the most. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jonathan said to David, \"Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'\" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.
