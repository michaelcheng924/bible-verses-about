","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, \"Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> This title was written on her forehead: MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. Then the angel said to me: \"Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then the angel said to me, \"The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.\" "},{"_id":"616b95b9ede035c13f932d2a","topicId":"616b95b6ede035c13f932d20","verse":"Revelation 13:8","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p66013008_01-10\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66013008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>8</strong> And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.  <strong>31</strong> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  <strong>33</strong> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit-- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this was how the promise was stated: \"At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand: <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> not by works but by him who calls--she was told, \"The older will serve the younger.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Just as it is written: \"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For he says to Moses, \"I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: \"I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> One of you will say to me: \"Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? \"Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory-- <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As he says in Hosea: \"I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one,\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and, \"It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: \"Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> It is just as Isaiah said previously: \"Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the \"stumbling stone.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> As it is written: \"See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" "},{"_id":"616b95beede035c13f932d39","topicId":"616b95b6ede035c13f932d20","verse":"Acts 2:1-47","votes":1,"__v":0,"kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.  <strong>2</strong> And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.  <strong>3</strong> And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  <strong>4</strong> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.  <strong>5</strong> And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.  <strong>6</strong> Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.  <strong>7</strong> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. "}]}
