Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  <strong>16</strong> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:  <strong>17</strong> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  <strong>18</strong> For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.  <strong>19</strong> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  <strong>20</strong> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are  pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.  <strong>21</strong> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  <strong>22</strong> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  <strong>23</strong> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth  not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You, then, why do you judge your brother?

Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Do you see all these things?\" he asked. \"I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. \"Tell us,\" they said, \"when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus answered: \"Watch out that no one deceives you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ, 'and will deceive many. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All these are the beginning of birth pains. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel--let the reader understand-- <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect--if that were possible. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> See, I have told you ahead of time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Immediately after the distress of those days \"'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
