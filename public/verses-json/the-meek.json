But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  <strong>15</strong> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  <strong>16</strong> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <strong>17</strong>           Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  <strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <strong>21</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  <strong>24</strong> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <strong>25</strong> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  <strong>26</strong> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <strong>27</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  <strong>28</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  <strong>29</strong> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>30</strong> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>31</strong> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  <strong>32</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <strong>33</strong>           Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  <strong>34</strong> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  <strong>35</strong> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  <strong>36</strong> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  <strong>37</strong> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <strong>38</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  <strong>39</strong> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  <strong>40</strong> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.  <strong>41</strong> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  <strong>42</strong> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <strong>43</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  <strong>44</strong> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  <strong>45</strong> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  <strong>46</strong> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  <strong>47</strong> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  <strong>48</strong> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and he began to teach them saying: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
