And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  <strong>2</strong> And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  <strong>3</strong> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  <strong>4</strong> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  <strong>5</strong> But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  <strong>6</strong> He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  <strong>7</strong> Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  <strong>16</strong> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  <strong>17</strong> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  <strong>18</strong> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  <strong>19</strong> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  <strong>20</strong> But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  <strong>21</strong> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  <strong>22</strong> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.  <strong>23</strong> Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  <strong>24</strong> Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.  <strong>25</strong> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.  <strong>26</strong> These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.  <strong>27</strong> But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  <strong>28</strong> And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.  <strong>29</strong> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,  neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.  <strong>14</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.  <strong>15</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.  <strong>16</strong> Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!  <strong>17</strong> Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?  <strong>18</strong> And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.  <strong>19</strong> Ye fools and blind: for whether is  greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?  <strong>20</strong> Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.  <strong>21</strong> And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.  <strong>22</strong> And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.  <strong>23</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,  <strong>30</strong> And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.  <strong>31</strong> Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.  <strong>32</strong> Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.  <strong>33</strong> Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? <strong>34</strong>           Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:  <strong>35</strong> That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.  <strong>36</strong> Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.  <strong>37</strong> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!  <strong>38</strong> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.  <strong>39</strong> For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.  <strong>1</strong>           And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.  <strong>2</strong> And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. <strong>3</strong> And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  <strong>4</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.  <strong>5</strong> For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.  <strong>6</strong> And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.  <strong>7</strong> For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.  <strong>8</strong> All these are the beginning of sorrows.  <strong>9</strong> Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.  <strong>10</strong> And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.  <strong>11</strong> And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.  <strong>12</strong> And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.  <strong>13</strong> But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  <strong>14</strong> And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.  <strong>15</strong> When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) <strong>16</strong> Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:  <strong>17</strong> Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:  <strong>18</strong> Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.  <strong>19</strong> And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!  <strong>20</strong> But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:  <strong>21</strong> For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.  <strong>22</strong> And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.  <strong>23</strong> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.  <strong>24</strong> For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  <strong>25</strong> Behold, I have told you before.  <strong>26</strong> Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.  <strong>27</strong> For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  <strong>28</strong> For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. <strong>29</strong>           Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  <strong>30</strong> And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  <strong>31</strong> And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  <strong>32</strong> Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:  <strong>33</strong> So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.  <strong>34</strong> Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  <strong>35</strong> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  <strong>36</strong>           But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.  <strong>37</strong> But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  <strong>38</strong> For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,  <strong>39</strong> And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  <strong>40</strong> Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>41</strong> Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <strong>42</strong>           Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.  <strong>43</strong> But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.  <strong>44</strong> Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.  <strong>45</strong> Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  <strong>46</strong> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  <strong>47</strong> Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.  <strong>48</strong> But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;  <strong>49</strong> And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;  <strong>50</strong> The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,  <strong>51</strong> And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
