And they bare it.  <strong>9</strong> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,  <strong>10</strong> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.  <strong>11</strong> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, \"They have no more wine.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"Dear woman, why do you involve me?\" Jesus replied, \"My time has not yet come.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> His mother said to the servants, \"Do whatever he tells you.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jesus said to the servants, \"Fill the jars with water\"; so they filled them to the brim. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then he told them, \"Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They did so, and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and said, \"Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.
