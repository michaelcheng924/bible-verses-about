 <strong>15</strong> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were  under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.  <strong>16</strong> For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  <strong>17</strong> For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.  <strong>18</strong> Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.  <strong>19</strong> For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,  <strong>20</strong> Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.  <strong>21</strong> Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.  <strong>22</strong> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  <strong>23</strong> It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  <strong>24</strong> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:  <strong>25</strong> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;  <strong>26</strong> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  <strong>27</strong> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:  <strong>28</strong> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.

In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings--external regulations applying until the time of the new order. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He said, \"This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and to show true humility toward all men. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Warn a divisive person once, and then warn him a second time. After that, have nothing to do with him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> You may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order that they may provide for daily necessities and not live unproductive lives. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
