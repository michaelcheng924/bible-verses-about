I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.  <strong>5</strong> The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.  <strong>6</strong> They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.  <strong>7</strong> So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.  <strong>8</strong> But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.  <strong>9</strong> Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.  <strong>10</strong> Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish.  <strong>12</strong> Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.  <strong>13</strong> For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.  <strong>14</strong> Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>15</strong> Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.  <strong>16</strong> Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, and  shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>17</strong> When the poor and needy seek water, and there is  none, and their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.  <strong>18</strong> I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.  <strong>19</strong> I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and  the pine, and the box tree together:  <strong>20</strong> That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.  <strong>21</strong> Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons,  saith the King of Jacob.  <strong>22</strong> Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.  <strong>23</strong> Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.  <strong>24</strong> Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an abomination is he that chooseth you.  <strong>25</strong> I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth clay.  <strong>26</strong> Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea, there is  none that heareth your words.  <strong>27</strong> The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.  <strong>28</strong> For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.  <strong>29</strong> Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.  <strong>1</strong> Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.  <strong>2</strong> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.  <strong>3</strong> A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.  <strong>4</strong> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.  <strong>5</strong> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:  <strong>6</strong> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;  <strong>7</strong> To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.  <strong>8</strong> I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.  <strong>10</strong> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.  <strong>11</strong> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,  the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.  <strong>12</strong> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.  <strong>14</strong> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and  refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.  <strong>15</strong> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.  <strong>16</strong> And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.  <strong>17</strong> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.  <strong>18</strong> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.  <strong>19</strong> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD’S servant?  <strong>20</strong> Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.  <strong>22</strong> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are  all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.  <strong>23</strong> Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?  <strong>24</strong> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.  <strong>1</strong> But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.  <strong>2</strong> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.  <strong>3</strong> For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.  <strong>4</strong> Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.  <strong>5</strong> Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;  <strong>6</strong> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;  <strong>7</strong> Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.  <strong>8</strong> Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.  <strong>9</strong> Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.  <strong>10</strong> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.  <strong>11</strong> I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is  no saviour.  <strong>12</strong> I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was  no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.  <strong>13</strong> Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is  none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?  <strong>14</strong> Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.  <strong>15</strong> I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.  <strong>16</strong> Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;  <strong>17</strong> Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.  <strong>18</strong> Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.  <strong>19</strong> Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.  <strong>20</strong> The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.  <strong>21</strong> This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.  <strong>22</strong> But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.  <strong>23</strong> Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.  <strong>24</strong> Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.  <strong>25</strong> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.  <strong>26</strong> Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.  <strong>27</strong> Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.  <strong>28</strong> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.  <strong>1</strong> Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.  <strong>3</strong> For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:  <strong>4</strong> And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.  <strong>5</strong> One shall say, I am the LORD’S; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.  <strong>7</strong> And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.  <strong>8</strong> Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any. <strong>9</strong> They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.  <strong>10</strong> Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?  <strong>11</strong> Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.  <strong>12</strong> The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.  <strong>13</strong> The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.  <strong>14</strong> He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.  <strong>15</strong> Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.  <strong>16</strong> He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:  <strong>17</strong> And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.  <strong>18</strong> They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.  <strong>19</strong> And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?  <strong>20</strong> He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?  <strong>21</strong> Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.  <strong>22</strong> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.  <strong>23</strong> Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.  <strong>24</strong> Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;  <strong>25</strong> That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;  <strong>26</strong> That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:  <strong>27</strong> That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:  <strong>28</strong> That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.  <strong>1</strong> Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;  <strong>2</strong> I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:  <strong>3</strong> And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee  by thy name, am the God of Israel.  <strong>4</strong> For Jacob my servant’s sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.  <strong>5</strong> I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is  no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:  <strong>6</strong> That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is  none else.  <strong>7</strong> I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.  <strong>8</strong> Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it.  <strong>9</strong> Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?  <strong>10</strong> Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?  <strong>11</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.  <strong>12</strong> I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.  <strong>13</strong> I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.  <strong>14</strong> Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying,  Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no God.  <strong>15</strong> Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.  <strong>16</strong> They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.  <strong>17</strong> But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end.  <strong>18</strong> For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.  <strong>19</strong> I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.  <strong>20</strong> Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are  escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.  <strong>21</strong> Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none beside me.  <strong>22</strong> Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.  <strong>23</strong> I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in  righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.  <strong>24</strong> Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.  <strong>25</strong> In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.  <strong>1</strong> Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden; they are  a burden to the weary beast.  <strong>2</strong> They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.  <strong>3</strong> Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:  <strong>4</strong> And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you. <strong>5</strong> To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?  <strong>6</strong> They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea, they worship.  <strong>7</strong> They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one  shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.  <strong>8</strong> Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.  <strong>9</strong> Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is  none like me,  <strong>10</strong> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:  <strong>11</strong> Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.  <strong>12</strong> Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness:  <strong>13</strong> I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.  <strong>1</strong> Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.  <strong>2</strong> Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.  <strong>3</strong> Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a man.  <strong>4</strong> As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>5</strong> Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.  <strong>6</strong> I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.  <strong>7</strong> And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.  <strong>8</strong> Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:  <strong>9</strong> But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.  <strong>10</strong> For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put if off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.  <strong>12</strong> Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.  <strong>13</strong> Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.  <strong>14</strong> Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: there shall  not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.  <strong>15</strong> Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even  thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee.  <strong>1</strong> Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.  <strong>2</strong> For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>3</strong> I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.  <strong>4</strong> Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;  <strong>5</strong> I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.  <strong>6</strong> Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it?  I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.  <strong>7</strong> They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.  <strong>8</strong> Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.  <strong>9</strong> For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.  <strong>10</strong> Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.  <strong>11</strong> For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.  <strong>12</strong> Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.  <strong>13</strong> Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.  <strong>14</strong> All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.  <strong>15</strong> I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.  <strong>16</strong> Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.  <strong>17</strong> Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am  the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.  <strong>18</strong> O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:  <strong>19</strong> Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.  <strong>20</strong> Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.  <strong>21</strong> And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.  <strong>22</strong> There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.  <strong>1</strong> Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.  <strong>2</strong> And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;  <strong>3</strong> And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.  <strong>4</strong> Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.  <strong>5</strong> And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be  his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.  <strong>6</strong> And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.  <strong>7</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.  <strong>8</strong> Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;  <strong>9</strong> That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are  in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.  <strong>10</strong> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.  <strong>11</strong> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.  <strong>12</strong> Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.  <strong>13</strong> Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.  <strong>14</strong> But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  <strong>15</strong> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.  <strong>16</strong> Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.  <strong>17</strong> Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.  <strong>18</strong> Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.  <strong>19</strong> For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.  <strong>20</strong> The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.  <strong>21</strong> Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?  <strong>22</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their  shoulders.  <strong>23</strong> And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.  <strong>24</strong> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?  <strong>25</strong> But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.  <strong>26</strong> And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.  <strong>1</strong> Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother’s divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it  to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.  <strong>2</strong> Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.  <strong>3</strong> I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.  <strong>4</strong> The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.  <strong>5</strong> The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.  <strong>6</strong> I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.  <strong>7</strong> For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.  <strong>8</strong> He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that  shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.  <strong>10</strong> Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves  about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.  <strong>1</strong> Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.  <strong>2</strong> Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.  <strong>3</strong> For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.  <strong>4</strong> Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.  <strong>5</strong> My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust.  <strong>6</strong> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.  <strong>7</strong> Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.  <strong>8</strong> For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.  <strong>9</strong> Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?  <strong>10</strong> Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?  <strong>11</strong> Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.  <strong>12</strong> I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that  shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;  <strong>13</strong> And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?  <strong>14</strong> The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.  <strong>15</strong> But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>16</strong> And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.  <strong>17</strong> Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.  <strong>18</strong> There is none to guide her among all the sons whom  she hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.  <strong>19</strong> These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?  <strong>20</strong> Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.  <strong>21</strong> Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:  <strong>22</strong> Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:  <strong>23</strong> But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.  <strong>1</strong> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.  <strong>2</strong> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.  <strong>3</strong> For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.  <strong>4</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.  <strong>5</strong> Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day is blasphemed.  <strong>6</strong> Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know  in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is  I.  <strong>7</strong> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!  <strong>8</strong> Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.  <strong>9</strong> Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.  <strong>10</strong> The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.  <strong>11</strong> Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.  <strong>12</strong> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rereward.  <strong>13</strong> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.  <strong>14</strong> As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:  <strong>15</strong> So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.  <strong>1</strong> Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?  <strong>2</strong> For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.  <strong>3</strong> He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.  <strong>4</strong> Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.  <strong>5</strong> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was  bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was  upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.  <strong>6</strong> All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.  <strong>7</strong> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.  <strong>8</strong> He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.  <strong>9</strong> And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.  <strong>10</strong> Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.  <strong>11</strong> He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.  <strong>1</strong> Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;  <strong>3</strong> For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.  <strong>4</strong> Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.  <strong>5</strong> For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is  his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall he be called.  <strong>6</strong> For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God.  <strong>7</strong> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.  <strong>8</strong> In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer.  <strong>9</strong> For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as  I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.  <strong>10</strong> For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.  <strong>11</strong> O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.  <strong>12</strong> And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.  <strong>13</strong> And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.  <strong>14</strong> In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.  <strong>15</strong> Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.  <strong>16</strong> Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.  <strong>17</strong> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.  <strong>2</strong> Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.  <strong>3</strong> Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.  <strong>4</strong> Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.  <strong>5</strong> Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.  <strong>6</strong> Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:  <strong>7</strong> Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.  <strong>8</strong> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are  your ways my ways, saith the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.  <strong>10</strong> For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:  <strong>11</strong> So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.  <strong>12</strong> For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.  <strong>13</strong> Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the LORD's hand double for all her sins. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> A voice of one calling: \"In the desert prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all mankind together will see it. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> A voice says, \"Cry out.\" And I said, \"What shall I cry?All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the LORD blows on them. Surely the people are grass. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You who bring good tidings to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, \"Here is your God!\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> See, the Sovereign LORD comes with power, and his arm rules for him. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Who has understood the mind of the LORD, or instructed him as his counselor? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Whom did the LORD consult to enlighten him, and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are regarded as dust on the scales; he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Before him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> To whom, then, will you compare God? What image will you compare him to? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> As for an idol, a craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> A man too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot. He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?\" says the Holy One. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, \"My way is hidden from the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God\"? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.

hath he made mention of my name.  <strong>2</strong> And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;  <strong>3</strong> And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.  <strong>4</strong> Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.  <strong>5</strong> And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be  his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.  <strong>6</strong> And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.  <strong>7</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.  <strong>8</strong> Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;  <strong>9</strong> That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are  in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.  <strong>10</strong> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.  <strong>11</strong> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.  <strong>12</strong> Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.  <strong>13</strong> Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.  <strong>14</strong> But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  <strong>15</strong> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.  <strong>16</strong> Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.  <strong>17</strong> Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.  <strong>18</strong> Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee.

I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these-where have they come from?'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"See, I will beckon to the Gentiles, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet.

power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.  <strong>2</strong> And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.  <strong>3</strong> For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.  <strong>4</strong> And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.  <strong>5</strong> For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.  <strong>6</strong> Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  <strong>7</strong> How

Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is  the Lord God who judgeth her.  <strong>9</strong> And the kings

scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,  <strong>13</strong> And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.  <strong>14</strong> And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.  <strong>15</strong> The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,  <strong>16</strong> And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!  <strong>17</strong> For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  <strong>18</strong> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!  <strong>19</strong> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.  <strong>20</strong> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.  <strong>21</strong> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <strong>22</strong> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <strong>23</strong> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  <strong>24</strong> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.

The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then I heard another voice from heaven say: \"Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done.

In one hour your doom has come!' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more-- <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"They will say, 'The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: \"With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's great men. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> In her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints, and of all who have been killed on the earth.\" "},{"_id":"616b3b3dede035c13f932370","topicId":"616b3b35ede035c13f932358","verse":"1 John 2:1-29","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p62002001_04-24\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v62002001-1\">2:1&nbsp;</b>My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.

And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  <strong>2</strong> And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  <strong>3</strong> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  <strong>4</strong> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  <strong>5</strong> But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  <strong>6</strong> He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  <strong>7</strong> Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  <strong>16</strong> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  <strong>17</strong> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  <strong>18</strong> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  <strong>19</strong> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  <strong>20</strong> But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  <strong>21</strong> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  <strong>22</strong> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.  <strong>23</strong> Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  <strong>24</strong> Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.  <strong>25</strong> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.  <strong>26</strong> These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.  <strong>27</strong> But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  <strong>28</strong> And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.  <strong>29</strong> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.
