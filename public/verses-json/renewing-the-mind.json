understanding;  <strong>4</strong> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for  hid treasures;  <strong>5</strong> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.  <strong>6</strong> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.  <strong>7</strong> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.  <strong>8</strong> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.  <strong>9</strong> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.  <strong>10</strong> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;  <strong>11</strong> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:  <strong>12</strong> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;  <strong>13</strong> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;  <strong>14</strong> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;  <strong>15</strong> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
