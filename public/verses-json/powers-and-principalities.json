dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance- <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If they say, \"Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul; <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> let's swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse\"- <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds! <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares; <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech: <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you- <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.\" "},{"_id":"616979f4bda5ba8d73708407","topicId":"616979edbda5ba8d737083f0","verse":"Ephesians 3:10","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p49003010_01-24\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v49003010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>10</strong> To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,  ","niv":"<sup><strong>10</strong></sup> His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,"},{"_id":"616979f4bda5ba8d73708408","topicId":"616979edbda5ba8d737083f0","verse":"Revelation 1:5","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p66001005_01-25\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66001005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.</p>\n<p id=\"p66001005_01-25\">To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>5</strong> And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and  the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.
