Others became priests without any oath, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: \"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Such a high priest meets our need--one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.

What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "},{"_id":"615a22016e3cd1721ad71449","topicId":"615a22006e3cd1721ad71444","verse":"Zephaniah 2:1-15","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span

The LORD their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore, as surely as I live,\" declares the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, \"surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah- a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the land. The nations on every shore will worship him, every one in its own land. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"You too, O Cushites, will be slain by my sword.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their calls will echo through the windows, rubble will be in the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is the carefree city that lived in safety. She said to herself, \"I am, and there is none besides me.\" What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.

So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  <strong>17</strong> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.  <strong>19</strong> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;  <strong>20</strong> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of  the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of  that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.  <strong>21</strong> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <strong>22</strong> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.  <strong>23</strong> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <strong>24</strong> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  <strong>25</strong> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.  <strong>26</strong> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  <strong>27</strong> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.  <strong>28</strong> Hitherto is the end of the matter.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\" "},{"_id":"615a22026e3cd1721ad7144c","topicId":"615a22006e3cd1721ad71444","verse":"Daniel 4:1-37","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p27004001_04-8\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v27004001-1\">4:1&nbsp;</b> King Nebuchadnezzar to all peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you! <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v27004002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>It has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.</p>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p27004003_04-8\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v27004003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How great are his signs,</span><br><span id=\"p27004003_04-8\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how mighty his wonders!</span><br><span id=\"p27004003_04-8\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,</span><br><span id=\"p27004003_04-8\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his dominion endures from generation to generation.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p27004003_07-8\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v27004004-1\">4&nbsp;</b> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v27004005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>I saw a dream that made me afraid.

Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men  of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.  <strong>19</strong> Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.  <strong>20</strong> The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;  <strong>21</strong> Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:  <strong>22</strong> It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.  <strong>23</strong> And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;  <strong>24</strong> This is the interpretation, O king, and this is  the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:  <strong>25</strong> That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.  <strong>26</strong> And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.  <strong>28</strong> All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.  <strong>29</strong> At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.  <strong>30</strong> The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?  <strong>31</strong> While the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.  <strong>32</strong> And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be  with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.  <strong>33</strong> The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws.  <strong>34</strong> And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:  <strong>35</strong> And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among  the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?  <strong>36</strong> At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.  <strong>37</strong> Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> King Nebuchadnezzar, To the peoples, nations and men of every language, who live in all the world: May you prosper greatly! <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> It is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has performed for me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> How great are his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion endures from generation to generation. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at home in my palace, contented and prosperous. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying in my bed, the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So I commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners came, I told them the dream, but they could not interpret it for me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Finally, Daniel came into my presence and I told him the dream. (He is called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.) <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I said, \"Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is my dream; interpret it for me. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> These are the visions I saw while lying in my bed: I looked, and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land. Its height was enormous. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky; it was visible to the ends of the earth. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and on it was food for all. Under it the beasts of the field found shelter, and the birds of the air lived in its branches; from it every creature was fed. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In the visions I saw while lying in my bed, I looked, and there before me was a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He called in a loud voice: 'Cut down the tree and trim off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But let the stump and its roots, bound with iron and bronze, remain in the ground, in the grass of the field. \"'Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal, till seven times pass by for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of men.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means, for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was greatly perplexed for a time, and his thoughts terrified him. So the king said, \"Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you.\" Belteshazzar answered, \"My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the beasts of the field, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds of the air- <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> you, O king, are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"You, O king, saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live like the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king: <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, O king, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> he said, \"Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, \"This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Immediately what had been said about Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever. His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: \"What have you done?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and glorify the King of heaven, because everything he does is right and all his ways are just. And those who walk in pride he is able to humble.

This too is meaningless. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owner except to feast his eyes on them? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when he has a son there is nothing left for him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Naked a man comes from his mother's womb, and as he comes, so he departs. He takes nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This too is a grievous evil: As a man comes, so he departs, and what does he gain, since he toils for the wind? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> All his days he eats in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then I realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given him-for this is his lot. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Moreover, when God gives any man wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work-this is a gift of God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He seldom reflects on the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with gladness of heart.

LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.  <strong>7</strong> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that  their corn and their wine increased.  <strong>8</strong> I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.  <strong>1</strong> Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.  <strong>2</strong> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.  <strong>3</strong> My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.  <strong>4</strong> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.  <strong>5</strong> The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.  <strong>6</strong> Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.  <strong>7</strong> But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.  <strong>8</strong> Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.  <strong>9</strong> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.  <strong>10</strong> Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.  <strong>11</strong> But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.  <strong>12</strong> For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.  <strong>1</strong> O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.  <strong>2</strong> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.  <strong>3</strong> My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?  <strong>4</strong> Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.  <strong>5</strong> For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?  <strong>6</strong> I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.  <strong>7</strong> Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.  <strong>8</strong> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.  <strong>9</strong> The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.  <strong>10</strong> Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.  <strong>1</strong> O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:  <strong>2</strong> Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.  <strong>3</strong> O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;  <strong>4</strong> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)  <strong>5</strong> Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.  <strong>6</strong> Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.  <strong>7</strong> So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.  <strong>8</strong> The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.  <strong>9</strong> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.  <strong>10</strong> My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.  <strong>11</strong> God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked  every day.  <strong>12</strong> If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.  <strong>13</strong> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.  <strong>14</strong> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.  <strong>15</strong> He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which  he made.  <strong>16</strong> His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.  <strong>17</strong> I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.  <strong>1</strong> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.  <strong>2</strong> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.  <strong>3</strong> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;  <strong>4</strong> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?  <strong>5</strong> For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.  <strong>6</strong> Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:  <strong>7</strong> All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;  <strong>8</strong> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever  passeth through the paths of the seas.  <strong>9</strong> O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!  <strong>1</strong> I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.  <strong>2</strong> I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.  <strong>3</strong> When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.  <strong>4</strong> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.  <strong>5</strong> Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.  <strong>6</strong> O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.  <strong>7</strong> But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.  <strong>8</strong> And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.  <strong>9</strong> The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.  <strong>10</strong> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.  <strong>11</strong> Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.  <strong>12</strong> When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.  <strong>13</strong> Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer  of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:  <strong>14</strong> That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.  <strong>15</strong> The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.  <strong>16</strong> The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.  <strong>17</strong> The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.  <strong>18</strong> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.  <strong>19</strong> Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.  <strong>20</strong> Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.  <strong>1</strong> Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself  in times of trouble?  <strong>2</strong> The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.  <strong>3</strong> For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.  <strong>4</strong> The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.  <strong>5</strong> His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.  <strong>6</strong> He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall  never be in adversity.  <strong>7</strong> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.  <strong>8</strong> He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.  <strong>9</strong> He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.  <strong>10</strong> He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.  <strong>11</strong> He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it. <strong>12</strong> Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.  <strong>13</strong> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it. <strong>14</strong> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.  <strong>15</strong> Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.  <strong>16</strong> The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.  <strong>17</strong> LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:  <strong>18</strong> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.  <strong>1</strong> In the LORD put I my trust: How say ye to my soul, Flee as  a bird to your mountain?  <strong>2</strong> For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.  <strong>3</strong> If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?  <strong>4</strong> The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD’S throne is  in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.  <strong>5</strong> The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.  <strong>6</strong> Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.  <strong>7</strong> For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.  <strong>1</strong> Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.  <strong>2</strong> They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.  <strong>3</strong> The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:  <strong>4</strong> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are  our own: who is lord over us?  <strong>5</strong> For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that  puffeth at him.  <strong>6</strong> The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.  <strong>7</strong> Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.  <strong>8</strong> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.  <strong>1</strong> How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?  <strong>2</strong> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?  <strong>3</strong> Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;  <strong>4</strong> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.  <strong>5</strong> But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.  <strong>6</strong> I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.  <strong>1</strong> The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.  <strong>2</strong> The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.  <strong>3</strong> They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  <strong>4</strong> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.  <strong>5</strong> There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.  <strong>6</strong> Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is  his refuge.  <strong>7</strong> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.  <strong>1</strong> LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?  <strong>2</strong> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.  <strong>3</strong>             He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.  <strong>4</strong> In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.  <strong>5</strong>             He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.  <strong>1</strong> Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.  <strong>2</strong>             O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art  my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;  <strong>3</strong>             But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.  <strong>4</strong> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after  another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.  <strong>5</strong> The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.  <strong>6</strong> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.  <strong>7</strong> I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.  <strong>8</strong> I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.  <strong>10</strong> For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>11</strong> Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.  <strong>1</strong> Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.  <strong>2</strong> Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.  <strong>3</strong> Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.  <strong>4</strong> Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.  <strong>5</strong> Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.  <strong>6</strong> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.  <strong>7</strong> Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. <strong>8</strong> Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,  <strong>9</strong> From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.  <strong>10</strong> They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.  <strong>11</strong> They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;  <strong>12</strong> Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.  <strong>13</strong> Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:  <strong>14</strong> From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.  <strong>15</strong> As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.  <strong>1</strong> I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.  <strong>2</strong> The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.  <strong>3</strong> I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  <strong>4</strong> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.  <strong>5</strong> The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.  <strong>6</strong> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.  <strong>7</strong> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.  <strong>8</strong> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  <strong>9</strong> He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was  under his feet.  <strong>10</strong> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.  <strong>11</strong> He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.  <strong>12</strong> At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.  <strong>14</strong> Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.  <strong>15</strong> Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.  <strong>16</strong> He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.  <strong>17</strong> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.  <strong>18</strong> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  <strong>19</strong> He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  <strong>20</strong> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  <strong>21</strong> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  <strong>22</strong> For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.  <strong>23</strong> I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.  <strong>25</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;  <strong>26</strong> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.  <strong>27</strong> For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.  <strong>28</strong> For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.  <strong>29</strong> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.  <strong>30</strong>             As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.  <strong>31</strong> For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?  <strong>32</strong>             It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.  <strong>33</strong> He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.  <strong>34</strong> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  <strong>35</strong> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.  <strong>36</strong> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.  <strong>37</strong> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.  <strong>38</strong> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.  <strong>39</strong> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  <strong>40</strong> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.  <strong>41</strong> They cried, but there was none to save them: even  unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  <strong>42</strong> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.  <strong>43</strong> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and  thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom  I have not known shall serve me.  <strong>44</strong> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.  <strong>45</strong> The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.  <strong>46</strong> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.  <strong>47</strong>             It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.  <strong>48</strong> He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  <strong>49</strong> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.  <strong>50</strong> Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.  <strong>1</strong> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.  <strong>2</strong> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.  <strong>3</strong>             There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.  <strong>4</strong> Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,  <strong>5</strong> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and  rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.  <strong>6</strong> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.  <strong>7</strong> The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.  <strong>8</strong> The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.  <strong>9</strong> The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.  <strong>10</strong> More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.  <strong>11</strong> Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.  <strong>12</strong> Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. <strong>13</strong> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.  <strong>14</strong> Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.  <strong>1</strong> The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;  <strong>2</strong> Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;  <strong>3</strong> Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.  <strong>4</strong> Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.  <strong>5</strong> We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.  <strong>6</strong> Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.  <strong>7</strong> Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.  <strong>8</strong> They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.  <strong>9</strong> Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.  <strong>19</strong> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.  <strong>20</strong> And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.  <strong>21</strong> And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.  <strong>22</strong> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.  <strong>24</strong> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,  <strong>25</strong> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.  <strong>26</strong> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,  <strong>27</strong> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.  <strong>28</strong> And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art  highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art  thou among women.  <strong>29</strong> And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.  <strong>30</strong> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.  <strong>31</strong> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.  <strong>32</strong> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:  <strong>33</strong> And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.  <strong>34</strong> Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?  <strong>35</strong> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.  <strong>36</strong> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.  <strong>37</strong> For with God nothing shall be impossible.  <strong>38</strong> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.  <strong>39</strong> And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;  <strong>40</strong> And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.  <strong>41</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:  <strong>42</strong> And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art  thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.  <strong>43</strong> And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  <strong>44</strong> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.  <strong>45</strong> And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.  <strong>46</strong> And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,  <strong>47</strong> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.  <strong>48</strong> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.  <strong>49</strong> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is  his name.  <strong>50</strong> And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.  <strong>51</strong> He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.  <strong>52</strong> He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.  <strong>53</strong> He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.  <strong>54</strong> He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his  mercy;  <strong>55</strong> As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.  <strong>56</strong> And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.  <strong>57</strong> Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.  <strong>58</strong> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.  <strong>59</strong> And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.  <strong>60</strong> And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.  <strong>61</strong> And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.  <strong>62</strong> And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.  <strong>63</strong> And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.  <strong>64</strong> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,  and he spake, and praised God.  <strong>65</strong> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.  <strong>66</strong> And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.  <strong>67</strong> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,  <strong>68</strong> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,  <strong>69</strong> And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;  <strong>70</strong> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:  <strong>71</strong> That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;  <strong>72</strong> To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;  <strong>73</strong> The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,  <strong>74</strong> That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,  <strong>75</strong> In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.  <strong>76</strong> And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  <strong>77</strong> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,  <strong>78</strong> Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,  <strong>79</strong> To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.  <strong>80</strong> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.  <strong>2</strong> (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)  <strong>3</strong> And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.  <strong>4</strong> And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)  <strong>5</strong> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.  <strong>6</strong> And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.  <strong>7</strong> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.  <strong>8</strong> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  <strong>9</strong> And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.  <strong>10</strong> And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.  <strong>11</strong> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.  <strong>12</strong> And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.  <strong>13</strong> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,  <strong>14</strong> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.  <strong>16</strong> And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.  <strong>17</strong> And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.  <strong>18</strong> And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.  <strong>19</strong> But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.  <strong>20</strong> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.  <strong>21</strong> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.  <strong>22</strong> And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;  <strong>23</strong> (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)  <strong>24</strong> And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.  <strong>25</strong> And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was  Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.  <strong>26</strong> And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.  <strong>27</strong> And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,  <strong>28</strong> Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,  <strong>29</strong> Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:  <strong>30</strong> For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,  <strong>31</strong> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;  <strong>32</strong> A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.  <strong>33</strong> And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.  <strong>34</strong> And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;  <strong>35</strong> (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.  <strong>36</strong> And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;  <strong>37</strong> And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.  <strong>38</strong> And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.  <strong>39</strong> And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.  <strong>40</strong> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.  <strong>41</strong> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.  <strong>42</strong> And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.  <strong>43</strong> And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.  <strong>44</strong> But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.  <strong>45</strong> And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.  <strong>46</strong> And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.  <strong>47</strong> And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.  <strong>48</strong> And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.  <strong>49</strong> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?  <strong>50</strong> And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.  <strong>51</strong> And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.  <strong>52</strong> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.
