And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  <strong>7</strong> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.  <strong>8</strong> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.  <strong>9</strong> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.  <strong>10</strong> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.  <strong>11</strong> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  <strong>12</strong> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own? <strong>13</strong>           No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.  <strong>8</strong> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  <strong>9</strong> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.  <strong>10</strong> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.  <strong>12</strong> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.  <strong>13</strong> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.  <strong>14</strong> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him  stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.  <strong>15</strong> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.  <strong>16</strong> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.  <strong>17</strong> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.  <strong>18</strong> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.  <strong>19</strong> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  <strong>20</strong> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  <strong>21</strong> And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.  <strong>22</strong> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.  <strong>23</strong> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. <strong>24</strong>           And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see?

Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts.  <strong>26</strong> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.  <strong>27</strong> This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  <strong>28</strong> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.  <strong>29</strong> And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.  <strong>30</strong> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.  <strong>31</strong> And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?  <strong>32</strong> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.  <strong>33</strong> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.  <strong>34</strong> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!  <strong>35</strong> But wisdom is justified of all her children. <strong>36</strong>           And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.  <strong>37</strong> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,  <strong>38</strong> And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.  <strong>39</strong> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  <strong>40</strong> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.  <strong>41</strong> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.  <strong>42</strong> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?  <strong>43</strong> Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.  <strong>44</strong> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.  <strong>45</strong> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.  <strong>46</strong> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.  <strong>47</strong> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.  <strong>49</strong> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  <strong>50</strong> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: \"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, \"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, \"Don't cry.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They were all filled with awe and praised God. \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" they said. \"God has come to help his people.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> he sent them to the Lord to ask, \"Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When the men came to Jesus, they said, \"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So he replied to the messengers, \"Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> This is the one about whom it is written: \"'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: \"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and \"sinners.\"' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.Tell me, teacher,\" he said. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Simon replied, \"I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.You have judged correctly,\" Jesus said. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The other guests began to say among themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\" "},{"_id":"6168e81a803fbb813a70a258","topicId":"6168e813803fbb813a70a241","verse":"Luke 1:26-38","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p42001026_05-24\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42001026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42001027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David.

And he left them, and departed.  <strong>5</strong> And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.  <strong>6</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  <strong>7</strong> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.  <strong>8</strong> Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?  <strong>9</strong> Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  <strong>10</strong> Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  <strong>11</strong> How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  <strong>12</strong> Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  <strong>13</strong> When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?  <strong>14</strong> And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.  <strong>15</strong> He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?  <strong>16</strong> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>18</strong> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  <strong>19</strong> And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.  <strong>21</strong> From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.  <strong>22</strong> Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.  <strong>23</strong> But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. <strong>24</strong> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  <strong>25</strong> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.  <strong>26</strong> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  <strong>27</strong> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.  <strong>28</strong> Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He replied, \"When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,' <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\" Jesus then left them and went away. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Be careful,\" Jesus said to them. \"Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They discussed this among themselves and said, \"It is because we didn't bring any bread.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, \"You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say the Son of Man is?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \"Never, Lord!\" he said. \"This shall never happen to you!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\" "},{"_id":"6168e81a803fbb813a70a25a","topicId":"6168e813803fbb813a70a241","verse":"Matthew 7:15","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p40007015_06-26\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007015-1\">15&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>15</strong>           Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
