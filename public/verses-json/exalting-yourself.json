But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And he arose and stood forth.  <strong>9</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?  <strong>10</strong> And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.  <strong>11</strong> And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.  <strong>12</strong> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.  <strong>13</strong> And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;  <strong>14</strong> Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,  <strong>15</strong> Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,  <strong>16</strong> And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.  <strong>17</strong> And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;  <strong>18</strong> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.  <strong>19</strong> And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.  <strong>20</strong> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.  <strong>21</strong> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.

 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"61608713a775948f9a152d10","topicId":"6160870ca775948f9a152cfc","verse":"Ecclesiastes 7:21","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p21007021_01-22\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v21007021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear your servant cursing you.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>21</strong> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:  ","niv":"<sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you-"},{"_id":"61608714a775948f9a152d13","topicId":"6160870ca775948f9a152cfc","verse":"Revelation 22:18","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p66022018_01-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66022018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book,</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>18</strong> For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:  ","niv":"<sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book."},{"_id":"61608714a775948f9a152d12","topicId":"6160870ca775948f9a152cfc","verse":"Proverbs 31:1-31","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p20031001_06-24\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v20031001-1\">31:1&nbsp;</b>The words of King Lemuel.

She is worth far more than rubies. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
