In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>9</strong> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.  <strong>11</strong> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.  <strong>12</strong> Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.  <strong>13</strong> They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.  <strong>14</strong> And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.  <strong>15</strong> But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. <strong>16</strong>           No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.  <strong>17</strong> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.  <strong>18</strong> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. <strong>19</strong> Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.  <strong>20</strong> And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.  <strong>21</strong> And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. <strong>22</strong> Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.  <strong>23</strong> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.  <strong>24</strong> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.  <strong>25</strong> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.  <strong>26</strong> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.  <strong>27</strong> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.  <strong>28</strong> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.  <strong>29</strong> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.  <strong>31</strong> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.  <strong>32</strong> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.  <strong>33</strong> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.  <strong>34</strong> When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.  <strong>35</strong> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  <strong>36</strong> They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.  <strong>37</strong> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.  <strong>38</strong> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,  <strong>39</strong> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.  <strong>40</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.  <strong>41</strong> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:  <strong>42</strong> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.  <strong>43</strong> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,  <strong>44</strong> Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.  <strong>45</strong> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  <strong>46</strong> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.  <strong>47</strong> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. <strong>49</strong> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.  <strong>50</strong> But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.  <strong>51</strong> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.  <strong>52</strong> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.  <strong>53</strong> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.  <strong>54</strong> And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.  <strong>55</strong> And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.  <strong>56</strong> And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.\" When he said this, he called out, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> His disciples asked him what this parable meant. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He said, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, \"'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He replied, \"My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> One day Jesus said to his disciples, \"Let's go over to the other side of the lake.\" So they got into a boat and set out. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we're going to drown!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. \"Where is your faith?\" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, \"Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Legion,\" he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Return home and tell how much God has done for you.\" So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" he said. \"Don't bother the teacher any more.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \"Stop wailing,\" Jesus said. \"She is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> But he took her by the hand and said, \"My child, get up!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.

And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.  <strong>7</strong> He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  <strong>8</strong> But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  <strong>9</strong> And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.  <strong>10</strong> And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,  <strong>11</strong> Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;  <strong>12</strong> And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names  of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:  <strong>13</strong> On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.  <strong>14</strong> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  <strong>15</strong> And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.  <strong>16</strong> And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.  <strong>17</strong> And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.  <strong>18</strong> And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.  <strong>19</strong> And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;  <strong>20</strong> The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.  <strong>21</strong> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.  <strong>22</strong> And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.  <strong>23</strong> And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.  <strong>24</strong> And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.  <strong>25</strong> And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.  <strong>27</strong> And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.  <strong>1</strong> And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.  <strong>2</strong> In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner  of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  <strong>3</strong> And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:  <strong>4</strong> And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.  <strong>5</strong> And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.  <strong>7</strong> Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.  <strong>8</strong> And I John saw these things, and heard them.

They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He who was seated on the throne said, \"I am making everything new!\" Then he said, \"Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said to me: \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, \"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits thick, by man's measurement, which the angel was using. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"616d833775868033c7104e93","topicId":"616d832f75868033c7104e7a","verse":"Matthew 12:30","votes":5,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40012030_01-27\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40012030-1\">30&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>30</strong> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.
