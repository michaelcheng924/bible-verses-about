Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It is written: \"'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
