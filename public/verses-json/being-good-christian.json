Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  <strong>10</strong> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  <strong>11</strong> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  <strong>13</strong> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  <strong>14</strong> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  <strong>15</strong> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  <strong>16</strong> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  <strong>17</strong> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  <strong>18</strong> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are  not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.  <strong>19</strong> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  <strong>20</strong> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  <strong>21</strong> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  <strong>22</strong> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  <strong>23</strong> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  <strong>24</strong> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  <strong>25</strong> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  <strong>26</strong> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  <strong>27</strong> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  <strong>28</strong> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  <strong>29</strong> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  <strong>30</strong> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  <strong>31</strong> What shall we then say to these things?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him.

Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth!
