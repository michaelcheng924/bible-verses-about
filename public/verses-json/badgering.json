But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  <strong>7</strong> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  <strong>8</strong> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.  <strong>9</strong> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own  conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even  unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.  <strong>10</strong> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?  <strong>11</strong> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. <strong>12</strong> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.  <strong>13</strong> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.  <strong>14</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.  <strong>15</strong> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.  <strong>16</strong> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.  <strong>17</strong> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.  <strong>18</strong> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.  <strong>19</strong> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.  <strong>20</strong> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>22</strong> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>23</strong> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.  <strong>24</strong> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.  <strong>25</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.  <strong>26</strong> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.  <strong>27</strong> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.  <strong>28</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.  <strong>29</strong> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.  <strong>30</strong> As he spake these words, many believed on him.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;  <strong>32</strong> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  <strong>33</strong> They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.  <strong>35</strong> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but  the Son abideth ever.  <strong>36</strong> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.  <strong>37</strong> I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.  <strong>38</strong> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.  <strong>39</strong> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.  <strong>40</strong> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.  <strong>41</strong> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.  <strong>42</strong> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.  <strong>43</strong> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.  <strong>44</strong> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your  father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.  <strong>45</strong> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.  <strong>46</strong> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?  <strong>47</strong> He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them  not, because ye are not of God.  <strong>48</strong> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  <strong>49</strong> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.  <strong>50</strong> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.  <strong>51</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.  <strong>52</strong> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.  <strong>53</strong> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  <strong>54</strong> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:  <strong>55</strong> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.  <strong>56</strong> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it,  and was glad.  <strong>57</strong> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  <strong>58</strong> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.  <strong>59</strong> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"No one, sir,\" she said. \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The Pharisees challenged him, \"Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"Where is your father?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You do not know me or my Father,\" Jesus replied. \"If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\" He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Once more Jesus said to them, \"I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> This made the Jews ask, \"Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But he continued, \"You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Who are you?\" they asked. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Just what I have been claiming all along,\" Jesus replied. \"I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So Jesus said, \"When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They answered him, \"We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father. \" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Abraham is our father,\" they answered. \"If you were Abraham's children,\" said Jesus, \"then you would <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> do the things Abraham did. As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> You are doing the things your own father does.We are not illegitimate children,\" they protested. \"The only Father we have is God himself.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The Jews answered him, \"Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"I am not possessed by a demon,\" said Jesus, \"but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> At this the Jews exclaimed, \"Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> \"You are not yet fifty years old,\" the Jews said to him, \"and you have seen Abraham!\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"before Abraham was born, I am!\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
