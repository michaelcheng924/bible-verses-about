Quail From the LORD <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, \"If only we had meat to eat! <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost-also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted like something made with olive oil. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Moses heard the people of every family wailing, each at the entrance to his tent. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.
