","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> What does the worker gain from his toil? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I have seen the burden God has laid on men. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil-this is the gift of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And I saw something else under the sun: In the place of judgment-wickedness was there, in the place of justice-wickedness was there. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I thought in my heart, \"God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I also thought, \"As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other.
