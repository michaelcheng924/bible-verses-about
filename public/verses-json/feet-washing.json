Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.  <strong>9</strong> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my  hands and my head.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.  <strong>11</strong> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.  <strong>12</strong> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?  <strong>13</strong> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.  <strong>14</strong> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.  <strong>15</strong> For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.  <strong>16</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.  <strong>17</strong> If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. <strong>18</strong>           I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.  <strong>19</strong> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.  <strong>20</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  <strong>21</strong> When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  <strong>22</strong> Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.  <strong>23</strong> Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.  <strong>24</strong> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.  <strong>25</strong> He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.

Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"No,\" said Peter, \"you shall never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered, \"Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then, Lord,\" Simon Peter replied, \"not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. \"Do you understand what I have done for you?\" he asked them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen.

And it was night. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When he was gone, Jesus said, \"Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"My children, I will be with you only a little longer.
