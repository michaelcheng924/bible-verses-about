But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The commandments, \"Do not commit adultery,Do not murder,Do not steal,Do not covet,\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.

Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.  <strong>28</strong> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.  <strong>29</strong> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.  <strong>30</strong> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.  <strong>31</strong> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.  <strong>32</strong> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men  unto me.  <strong>33</strong> This he said, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>34</strong> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?  who is this Son of man?  <strong>35</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.  <strong>36</strong> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.  <strong>37</strong> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:  <strong>38</strong> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  <strong>39</strong> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,  <strong>40</strong> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  <strong>41</strong> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.  <strong>42</strong> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:  <strong>43</strong> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.  <strong>44</strong> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.  <strong>45</strong> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.  <strong>46</strong> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.  <strong>47</strong> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.  <strong>48</strong> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.  <strong>49</strong> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  <strong>50</strong> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. \" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" Jesus replied. \"It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the Pharisees said to one another, \"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Father, glorify your name!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.\" The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"This voice was for your benefit, not mine. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\" When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: \"Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then Jesus cried out, \"When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I know that his command leads to eternal life.

Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  <strong>23</strong> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth  not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It is written: \"'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.

His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\" "},{"_id":"6161abe0c0307ca401cc451f","topicId":"6161abd9c0307ca401cc4509","verse":"Ezekiel 38:1-23","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p26038001_04-23\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v26038001-1\">38:1&nbsp;</b>The word of the LORD came to me: <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26038002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>“Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26038003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26038004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>And I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great host, all of them with buckler and shield, wielding swords. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26038005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet; <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26038006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Gomer and all his hordes; Beth-togarmah from the uttermost parts of the north with all his hordes—many peoples are with you.</p>\n<p id=\"p26038006_04-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26038007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>“Be ready and keep ready, you and all your hosts that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26038008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>After many days you will be mustered.

then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.  <strong>14</strong> But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.  <strong>15</strong> And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.  <strong>16</strong> And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.  <strong>17</strong> And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.  <strong>18</strong> And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:  <strong>19</strong> If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.  <strong>20</strong> And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.  <strong>21</strong> Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.  <strong>22</strong> If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.  <strong>23</strong> And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,  <strong>24</strong> Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,  <strong>25</strong> Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.  <strong>26</strong> And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.  <strong>27</strong> And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.  <strong>28</strong> If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.  <strong>29</strong> But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.  <strong>30</strong> If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.  <strong>31</strong> Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.  <strong>32</strong> If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.  <strong>33</strong> And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;  <strong>34</strong> The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.  <strong>35</strong> And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.  <strong>36</strong> Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"These are the laws you are to set before them: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"But if the servant declares, 'I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as menservants do. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Anyone who strikes a man and kills him shall surely be put to death. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> However, if he does not do it intentionally, but God lets it happen, he is to flee to a place I will designate. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But if a man schemes and kills another man deliberately, take him away from my altar and put him to death. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Anyone who attacks his father or his mother must be put to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"If men quarrel and one hits the other with a stone or with his fist and he does not die but is confined to bed, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> the one who struck the blow will not be held responsible if the other gets up and walks around outside with his staff; however, he must pay the injured man for the loss of his time and see that he is completely healed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"If a man hits a manservant or maidservant in the eye and destroys it, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the eye. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And if he knocks out the tooth of a manservant or maidservant, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the tooth. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull must be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held responsible. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If, however, the bull has had the habit of goring and the owner has been warned but has not kept it penned up and it kills a man or woman, the bull must be stoned and the owner also must be put to death. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> However, if payment is demanded of him, he may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> This law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If the bull gores a male or female slave, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave, and the bull must be stoned. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"If a man uncovers a pit or digs one and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> the owner of the pit must pay for the loss; he must pay its owner, and the dead animal will be his. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"If a man's bull injures the bull of another and it dies, they are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal equally. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> However, if it was known that the bull had the habit of goring, yet the owner did not keep it penned up, the owner must pay, animal for animal, and the dead animal will be his.
