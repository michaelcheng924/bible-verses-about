punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:  <strong>4</strong> But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.  <strong>5</strong> I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of
