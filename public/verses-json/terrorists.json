His disciples came to him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and he began to teach them saying: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;  <strong>19</strong> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?  <strong>20</strong> And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.  <strong>21</strong> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  <strong>22</strong> Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:  <strong>23</strong> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.  <strong>24</strong> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it:  but he could not be hid.  <strong>25</strong> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:  <strong>26</strong> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.  <strong>27</strong> But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.  <strong>28</strong> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.  <strong>29</strong> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.  <strong>30</strong> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.  <strong>31</strong> And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.  <strong>32</strong> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  <strong>34</strong> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,  that is, Be opened.  <strong>35</strong> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.  <strong>36</strong> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;  <strong>37</strong> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were \"unclean,\" that is, unwashed. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. ) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \"'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\") <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ). <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> People were overwhelmed with amazement. \"He has done everything well,\" they said. \"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\" "}]}
