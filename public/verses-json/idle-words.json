You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD's holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob.\" The mouth of the LORD has spoken.

iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.  <strong>3</strong> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.  <strong>4</strong> None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.  <strong>5</strong> They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.  <strong>6</strong> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.  <strong>7</strong> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.  <strong>8</strong> The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.  <strong>10</strong> We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had  no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.  <strong>11</strong> We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.  <strong>12</strong> For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for  our iniquities, we know them;  <strong>13</strong> In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.  <strong>14</strong> And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.  <strong>15</strong> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.  <strong>16</strong> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.  <strong>17</strong> For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.  <strong>18</strong> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.  <strong>19</strong> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.  <strong>20</strong> And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters wicked things. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments and speak lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark their ways. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks in them will know peace. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like men without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities: <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, fomenting oppression and revolt, uttering lies our hearts have conceived. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm worked salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> From the west, men will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the LORD drives along. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"As for me, this is my covenant with them,\" says the LORD. \"My Spirit, who is on you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth, or from the mouths of your children, or from the mouths of their descendants from this time on and forever,\" says the LORD.

They shall live on the offerings made to the LORD by fire, for that is their inheritance. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the jowls and the inner parts. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> for the LORD your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the LORD's name always. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> he may minister in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the LORD. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You must be blameless before the LORD your God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For this is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, \"Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The LORD said to me: \"What they say is good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You may say to yourselves, \"How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him. "}]}
