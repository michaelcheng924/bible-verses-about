She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, \"Surely not I?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"It is one of the Twelve,\" he replied, \"one who dips bread into the bowl with me. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take it; this is my body.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,\" he said to them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You will all fall away,\" Jesus told them, \"for it is written: \"'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Peter declared, \"Even if all fall away, I will not.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Peter insisted emphatically, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the others said the same. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,\" he said to them. \"Stay here and keep watch.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Abba, Father,\" he said, \"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Simon,\" he said to Peter, \"are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Returning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Then everyone deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> \"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. \"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.

And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.  <strong>8</strong> For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  <strong>9</strong> When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.  <strong>10</strong> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.  <strong>12</strong> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.  <strong>13</strong> And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.  <strong>14</strong> And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him  stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.  <strong>15</strong> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.  <strong>16</strong> And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.  <strong>17</strong> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.  <strong>18</strong> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.  <strong>19</strong> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  <strong>20</strong> When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?  <strong>21</strong> And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.  <strong>22</strong> Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.  <strong>23</strong> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. <strong>24</strong>           And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?  <strong>25</strong> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts.  <strong>26</strong> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.  <strong>27</strong> This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  <strong>28</strong> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.  <strong>29</strong> And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.  <strong>30</strong> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.  <strong>31</strong> And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?  <strong>32</strong> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.  <strong>33</strong> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.  <strong>34</strong> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!  <strong>35</strong> But wisdom is justified of all her children. <strong>36</strong>           And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.  <strong>37</strong> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,  <strong>38</strong> And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.  <strong>39</strong> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  <strong>40</strong> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.  <strong>41</strong> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.  <strong>42</strong> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?  <strong>43</strong> Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.  <strong>44</strong> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.  <strong>45</strong> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.  <strong>46</strong> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.  <strong>47</strong> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.  <strong>49</strong> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  <strong>50</strong> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, \"This man deserves to have you do this, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: \"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, \"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, \"Don't cry.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They were all filled with awe and praised God. \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" they said. \"God has come to help his people.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> he sent them to the Lord to ask, \"Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When the men came to Jesus, they said, \"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So he replied to the messengers, \"Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> This is the one about whom it is written: \"'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: \"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and \"sinners.\"' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.Tell me, teacher,\" he said. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Simon replied, \"I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.You have judged correctly,\" Jesus said. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The other guests began to say among themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\" "},{"_id":"616a0d1fbda5ba8d73708c5c","topicId":"616a0d18bda5ba8d73708c44","verse":"Mark 15:40","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p41015040_01-24\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41015040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>40</strong> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;  ","niv":"<sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some women were watching from a distance.
