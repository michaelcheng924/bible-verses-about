","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God called the expanse \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day.

But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.  <strong>7</strong> What then?

God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  <strong>12</strong> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?  <strong>13</strong> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  <strong>14</strong> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them.  <strong>15</strong> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  <strong>16</strong> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  <strong>17</strong> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  <strong>18</strong> Boast not against the branches.

Be not highminded, but fear:  <strong>21</strong> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.  <strong>22</strong> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  <strong>23</strong> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  <strong>24</strong> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?  <strong>25</strong> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  <strong>26</strong> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  <strong>27</strong> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  <strong>28</strong> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.  <strong>29</strong> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.  <strong>30</strong> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  <strong>31</strong> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  <strong>32</strong> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  <strong>33</strong> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  <strong>34</strong> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  <strong>35</strong> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  <strong>36</strong> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.

Otherwise, you also will be cut off. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \"The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!

I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird.

It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings--external regulations applying until the time of the new order. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God! <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He said, \"This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
