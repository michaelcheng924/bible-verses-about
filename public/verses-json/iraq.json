Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;  <strong>2</strong> And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.  <strong>3</strong> Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.  <strong>4</strong> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.  <strong>5</strong> For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD’S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.  <strong>7</strong> Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD’S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.  <strong>8</strong> Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.  <strong>9</strong> We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.  <strong>10</strong> The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.  <strong>11</strong> Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.  <strong>12</strong> Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.  <strong>15</strong> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.  <strong>16</strong> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.  <strong>17</strong> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  <strong>18</strong> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <strong>19</strong> The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is  the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>20</strong> Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;  <strong>21</strong> And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;  <strong>22</strong> With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;  <strong>23</strong> I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.  <strong>24</strong> And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.  <strong>25</strong> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.  <strong>28</strong> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.  <strong>29</strong> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.  <strong>30</strong> The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.  <strong>31</strong> One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,  <strong>32</strong> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.  <strong>33</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.  <strong>34</strong> Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.  <strong>35</strong> The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.  <strong>37</strong> And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.  <strong>38</strong> They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps.  <strong>39</strong> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.  <strong>40</strong> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.  <strong>41</strong> How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!  <strong>42</strong> The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.  <strong>43</strong> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.  <strong>44</strong> And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.  <strong>45</strong> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.  <strong>46</strong> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.  <strong>47</strong> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.  <strong>48</strong> Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.  <strong>49</strong> As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.  <strong>50</strong> Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.  <strong>51</strong> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house.  <strong>52</strong> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.  <strong>53</strong> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.  <strong>54</strong> A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:  <strong>55</strong> Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:  <strong>56</strong> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.  <strong>57</strong> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.  <strong>58</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.  <strong>59</strong> The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.  <strong>60</strong> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.  <strong>61</strong> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;  <strong>62</strong> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.  <strong>63</strong> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:  <strong>64</strong> And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are  the words of Jeremiah.

Run for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the LORD's vengeance; he will pay her what she deserves. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Babylon was a gold cup in the LORD's hand; she made the whole earth drunk.

The LORD will carry out his purpose, his decree against the people of Babylon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures, your end has come, the time for you to be cut off. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn by himself: I will surely fill you with men, as with a swarm of locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"He made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth.

Their strength is exhausted; they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire; the bars of her gates are broken. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One courier follows another and messenger follows messenger to announce to the king of Babylon that his entire city is captured, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> the river crossings seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers terrified.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"The Daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; the time to harvest her will soon come.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured us, he has thrown us into confusion, he has made us an empty jar.

What a horror Babylon will be among the nations! <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Her towns will be desolate, a dry and desert land, a land where no one lives, through which no man travels. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. And the wall of Babylon will fall. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives!

Remember the LORD in a distant land, and think on Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD's house.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"But days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Even if Babylon reaches the sky and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> \"The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The LORD will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the LORD is a God of retribution; he will repay in full. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake,\" declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"Babylon's thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations' labor is only fuel for the flames.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> This is the message Jeremiah gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon-all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> He said to Seraiah, \"When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Then say, 'O LORD, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither man nor animal will live in it; it will be desolate forever.' <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Then say, 'So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring upon her. And her people will fall.'\" The words of Jeremiah end here.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is the word the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Announce and proclaim among the nations, lift up a banner and proclaim it; keep nothing back, but say, 'Babylon will be captured; Bel will be put to shame, Marduk filled with terror. Her images will be put to shame and her idols filled with terror.' <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste her land. No one will live in it; both men and animals will flee away. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"In those days, at that time,\" declares the LORD, \"the people of Israel and the people of Judah together will go in tears to seek the LORD their God. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They will come and bind themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray and caused them to roam on the mountains. They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Whoever found them devoured them; their enemies said, 'We are not guilty, for they sinned against the LORD, their true pasture, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Flee out of Babylon; leave the land of the Babylonians, and be like the goats that lead the flock. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the land of the north. They will take up their positions against her, and from the north she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So Babylonia will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Because you rejoice and are glad, you who pillage my inheritance, because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain and neigh like stallions, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who gave you birth will be disgraced. She will be the least of the nations- a wilderness, a dry land, a desert. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Because of the LORD's anger she will not be inhabited but will be completely desolate. All who pass Babylon will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Take up your positions around Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Shout against her on every side! She surrenders, her towers fall, her walls are torn down. Since this is the vengeance of the LORD, take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done to others. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the reaper with his sickle at harvest. Because of the sword of the oppressor let everyone return to his own people, let everyone flee to his own land. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Israel is a scattered flock that lions have chased away. The first to devour him was the king of Assyria; the last to crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But I will bring Israel back to his own pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan; his appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In those days, at that time,\" declares the LORD, \"search will be made for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill and completely destroy them,\" declares the LORD. \"Do everything I have commanded you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The noise of battle is in the land, the noise of great destruction! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! How desolate is Babylon among the nations! <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I set a trap for you, O Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the LORD. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The LORD has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Come against her from afar. Break open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave her no remnant. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come, the time for them to be punished. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the LORD our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for his temple. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Summon archers against Babylon, all those who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"See, I am against you, O arrogant one,\" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty, \"for your day has come, the time for you to be punished. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The arrogant one will stumble and fall and no one will help her up; I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all who are around her.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Yet their Redeemer is strong; the LORD Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land, but unrest to those who live in Babylon. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"A sword against the Babylonians!\" declares the LORD - \"against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men! <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> A sword against her false prophets! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become women. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns,\" declares the LORD, \"so no one will live there; no man will dwell in it. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: The young of the flock will be dragged away; he will completely destroy their pasture because of them. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> At the sound of Babylon's capture the earth will tremble; its cry will resound among the nations.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> An oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout to them; beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I have commanded my holy ones; I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath- those who rejoice in my triumph. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Listen, a noise on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The LORD Almighty is mustering an army for war. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens- the LORD and the weapons of his wrath- to destroy the whole country. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Because of this, all hands will go limp, every man's heart will melt. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> See, the day of the LORD is coming -a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger- to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will make man scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives ravished. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the glory of the Babylonians' pride, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flocks there. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged. "}]}
