God knoweth.  <strong>12</strong> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.  <strong>13</strong> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.  <strong>14</strong> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.  <strong>16</strong> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.  <strong>17</strong> That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.  <strong>18</strong> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.  <strong>19</strong> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.  <strong>20</strong> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.  <strong>21</strong> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.  <strong>22</strong> Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am  I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.  <strong>23</strong> Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.  <strong>24</strong> Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.  <strong>25</strong> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;  <strong>26</strong> In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own  countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;  <strong>27</strong> In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.  <strong>28</strong> Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.  <strong>29</strong> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?  <strong>30</strong> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.  <strong>31</strong> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.  <strong>32</strong> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:  <strong>33</strong> And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those \"super-apostles.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.

What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then the herald loudly proclaimed, \"This is what you are commanded to do, O peoples, nations and men of every language: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> At this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, \"O king, live forever! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon-Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego-who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, \"Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, \"Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?\" They replied, \"Certainly, O king.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said, \"Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!\" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \"Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
