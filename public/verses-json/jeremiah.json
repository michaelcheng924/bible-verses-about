A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever cease to flow? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways and in the ancient paths.

So come, let's attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Listen to me, O LORD; hear what my accusers are saying! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But you know, O LORD, all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.

Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.  <strong>6</strong> Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.  <strong>7</strong> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.  <strong>8</strong> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is  a doctrine of vanities.  <strong>9</strong> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.  <strong>10</strong> But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.  <strong>11</strong> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.  <strong>12</strong> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.  <strong>13</strong> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.  <strong>14</strong> Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  <strong>15</strong> They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <strong>16</strong> The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is  the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>17</strong> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.  <strong>18</strong> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it  so.  <strong>19</strong> Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.  <strong>20</strong> My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.  <strong>21</strong> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.  <strong>22</strong> Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.  <strong>23</strong> O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.  <strong>24</strong> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.  <strong>25</strong> Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple- all made by skilled workers. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Tell them this: 'These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud; they have no breath in them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the tribe of his inheritance- the LORD Almighty is his name. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this is what the LORD says: \"At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, \"This is my sickness, and I must endure it.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My sons are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the LORD; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Listen! The report is coming- a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I know, O LORD, that a man's life is not his own; it is not for man to direct his steps. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Correct me, LORD, but only with justice- not in your anger, lest you reduce me to nothing. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.
