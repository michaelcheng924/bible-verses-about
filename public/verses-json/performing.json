O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  <strong>4</strong> A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.  <strong>5</strong> And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.  <strong>6</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  <strong>7</strong> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.  <strong>8</strong> Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?  <strong>9</strong> Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  <strong>10</strong> Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  <strong>11</strong> How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  <strong>12</strong> Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  <strong>13</strong> When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?  <strong>14</strong> And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.  <strong>15</strong> He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?  <strong>16</strong> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>18</strong> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  <strong>19</strong> And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.  <strong>21</strong> From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.  <strong>22</strong> Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.  <strong>23</strong> But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. <strong>24</strong> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  <strong>25</strong> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.  <strong>26</strong> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  <strong>27</strong> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.  <strong>28</strong> Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He replied, \"When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,' <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.\" Jesus then left them and went away. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Be careful,\" Jesus said to them. \"Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They discussed this among themselves and said, \"It is because we didn't bring any bread.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, \"You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, \"Who do people say the Son of Man is?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"But what about you?\" he asked. \"Who do you say I am?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. \"Never, Lord!\" he said. \"This shall never happen to you!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\" "},{"_id":"6168f869803fbb813a70ab04","topicId":"6168f864803fbb813a70aaf3","verse":"Matthew 6:21","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40006021_01-20\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40006021-1\">21&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>21</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
