But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be

wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a

calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with

<strong>13</strong> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.  <strong>14</strong> Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.  <strong>15</strong> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.  <strong>16</strong> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.  <strong>17</strong> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is  cruel troubleth his own flesh.  <strong>18</strong> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.  <strong>19</strong> As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.  <strong>20</strong> They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.  <strong>21</strong> Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.  <strong>22</strong> As a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.  <strong>23</strong> The desire of the

Let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm so that I will be free from pain.\" And God granted his request. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Kelub, Shuhah's brother, was the father of Mehir, who was the father of Eshton. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Eshton was the father of Beth Rapha, Paseah and Tehinnah the father of Ir Nahash. These were the men of Recah. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The sons of Kenaz: Othniel and Seraiah. The sons of Othniel: Hathath and Meonothai. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Meonothai was the father of Ophrah. Seraiah was the father of Joab, the father of Ge Harashim. It was called this because its people were craftsmen. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The sons of Caleb son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah and Naam. The son of Elah: Kenaz. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The sons of Jehallelel: Ziph, Ziphah, Tiria and Asarel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The sons of Ezrah: Jether, Mered, Epher and Jalon. One of Mered's wives gave birth to Miriam, Shammai and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> (His Judean wife gave birth to Jered the father of Gedor, Heber the father of Soco, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah.) These were the children of Pharaoh's daughter Bithiah, whom Mered had married. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The sons of Hodiah's wife, the sister of Naham: the father of Keilah the Garmite, and Eshtemoa the Maacathite. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sons of Shimon: Amnon, Rinnah, Ben-Hanan and Tilon. The descendants of Ishi: Zoheth and Ben-Zoheth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The sons of Shelah son of Judah: Er the father of Lecah, Laadah the father of Mareshah and the clans of the linen workers at Beth Ashbea, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jokim, the men of Cozeba, and Joash and Saraph, who ruled in Moab and Jashubi Lehem. (These records are from ancient times.) <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They were the potters who lived at Netaim and Gederah; they stayed there and worked for the king. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The descendants of Simeon: Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah and Shaul; <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Shallum was Shaul's son, Mibsam his son and Mishma his son. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The descendants of Mishma: Hammuel his son, Zaccur his son and Shimei his son. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many children; so their entire clan did not become as numerous as the people of Judah. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They lived in Beersheba, Moladah, Hazar Shual, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susim, Beth Biri and Shaaraim. These were their towns until the reign of David. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Their surrounding villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Token and Ashan-five towns- <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath. These were their settlements. And they kept a genealogical record. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah son of Amaziah, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Joel, Jehu son of Joshibiah, the son of Seraiah, the son of Asiel, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> also Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and Ziza son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The men listed above by name were leaders of their clans. Their families increased greatly, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and they went to the outskirts of Gedor to the east of the valley in search of pasture for their flocks. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They found rich, good pasture, and the land was spacious, peaceful and quiet. Some Hamites had lived there formerly. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The men whose names were listed came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. They attacked the Hamites in their dwellings and also the Meunites who were there and completely destroyed them, as is evident to this day. Then they settled in their place, because there was pasture for their flocks.

Now the famine was severe in Samaria, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Ahab had said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, \"Is it really you, my lord Elijah?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What have I done wrong,\" asked Obadiah, \"that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Elijah said, \"As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he saw Elijah, he said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have not made trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Elijah went before the people and said, \"How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.\" But the people said nothing. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to them, \"I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire-he is God.\" Then all the people said, \"What you say is good.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. \"O Baal, answer us!\" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At noon Elijah began to taunt them. \"Shout louder!\" he said. \"Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come here to me.\" They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Your name shall be Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Do it again,\" he said, and they did it again. \"Do it a third time,\" he ordered, and they did it the third time. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, \"The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Elijah commanded them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!\" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Go and look toward the sea,\" he told his servant. And he went up and looked. \"There is nothing there,\" he said. Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The seventh time the servant reported, \"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" So Elijah said, \"Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
