stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.  <strong>27</strong> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.  <strong>28</strong> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.  <strong>29</strong> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.  <strong>30</strong> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.  <strong>31</strong> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. <strong>1</strong> The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.  <strong>2</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD’S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.  <strong>3</strong> And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.  <strong>4</strong> And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.  <strong>5</strong> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.  <strong>6</strong> Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.  <strong>7</strong> Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any  end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:  <strong>8</strong> Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:  <strong>9</strong> And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself: therefore forgive them not.  <strong>10</strong> Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.  <strong>11</strong> The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.  <strong>12</strong> For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is  lifted up; and he shall be brought low:  <strong>13</strong> And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,  <strong>14</strong> And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are  lifted up,  <strong>15</strong> And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,  <strong>16</strong> And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.  <strong>17</strong> And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.  <strong>18</strong> And the idols he shall utterly abolish.  <strong>19</strong> And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.  <strong>20</strong> In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;  <strong>21</strong> To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.  <strong>22</strong> Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?  <strong>1</strong> For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,  <strong>2</strong> The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,  <strong>3</strong> The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.  <strong>4</strong> And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.  <strong>5</strong> And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.  <strong>6</strong> When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let  this ruin be under thy hand:  <strong>7</strong> In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.  <strong>8</strong> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.  <strong>9</strong> The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.  <strong>10</strong> Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him:  for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.  <strong>11</strong> Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him:  for the reward of his hands shall be given him.  <strong>12</strong>           As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee  to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.  <strong>15</strong> What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the LORD GOD of hosts.  <strong>16</strong> Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:  <strong>17</strong> Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.  <strong>18</strong> In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their  tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their  cauls, and their round tires like the moon,  <strong>19</strong> The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,  <strong>20</strong> The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,  <strong>21</strong> The rings, and nose jewels,  <strong>22</strong> The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,  <strong>23</strong> The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.  <strong>24</strong> And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and  burning instead of beauty.  <strong>25</strong> Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.  <strong>26</strong> And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.  <strong>1</strong> And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.  <strong>2</strong> In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.  <strong>3</strong> And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even  every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:  <strong>4</strong> When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.  <strong>5</strong> And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory shall be a defence.  <strong>6</strong> And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.  <strong>1</strong> Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:  <strong>2</strong> And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.  <strong>3</strong> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.  <strong>4</strong> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?  <strong>5</strong> And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:  <strong>6</strong> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.  <strong>7</strong> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.  <strong>8</strong> Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!  <strong>9</strong> In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.  <strong>10</strong> Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.  <strong>11</strong> Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!  <strong>12</strong> And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have  no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.  <strong>15</strong> And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:  <strong>16</strong> But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.  <strong>17</strong> Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.  <strong>18</strong> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:  <strong>19</strong> That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it! <strong>20</strong> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!  <strong>21</strong> Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!  <strong>22</strong> Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:  <strong>23</strong> Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!  <strong>24</strong> Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is  stretched out still.  <strong>26</strong> And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:  <strong>27</strong> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:  <strong>28</strong> Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:  <strong>29</strong> Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.  <strong>30</strong> And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and  sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.  <strong>1</strong> In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.  <strong>2</strong> Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.  <strong>3</strong> And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is  the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.  <strong>4</strong> And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.  <strong>5</strong> Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am  a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.  <strong>6</strong> Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:  <strong>7</strong> And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.  <strong>8</strong> Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.  <strong>9</strong> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.  <strong>10</strong> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.  <strong>11</strong> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,  <strong>12</strong> And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.  <strong>13</strong> But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be  the substance thereof.

And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.  <strong>15</strong> Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.  <strong>16</strong> And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.  <strong>17</strong> And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.  <strong>18</strong> Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.  <strong>19</strong> And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.  <strong>20</strong> And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.  <strong>21</strong> And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.  <strong>22</strong> And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them  throughout all the way, but found them not.  <strong>23</strong> So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things  that befell them:  <strong>24</strong> And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.  <strong>1</strong> And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.  <strong>2</strong> And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;  <strong>3</strong> And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.  <strong>4</strong> Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.  <strong>5</strong> And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.  <strong>6</strong> And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.  <strong>7</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.  <strong>8</strong> And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.  <strong>9</strong> And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.  <strong>10</strong> And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is  among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.  <strong>12</strong> Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.  <strong>13</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;  <strong>15</strong> And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)  <strong>16</strong> That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.  <strong>17</strong> And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,  <strong>3</strong> And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.  <strong>4</strong> Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:  <strong>5</strong> And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:  <strong>6</strong> That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  <strong>7</strong> Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.  <strong>8</strong> And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.  <strong>9</strong> And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.  <strong>10</strong> For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.  <strong>12</strong> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:  <strong>13</strong> About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.  <strong>14</strong> On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.  <strong>15</strong> And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,  <strong>16</strong> Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.  <strong>17</strong> Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.  <strong>18</strong> And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.  <strong>19</strong> And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.  <strong>20</strong> And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.  <strong>21</strong> And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?  <strong>22</strong> Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.  <strong>23</strong> For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:  <strong>24</strong> That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.  <strong>2</strong> At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.  <strong>3</strong> And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.  <strong>4</strong> And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.  <strong>5</strong> Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.  <strong>6</strong> For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.  <strong>7</strong> And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.  <strong>10</strong> And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.  <strong>11</strong> And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.  <strong>12</strong> And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.  <strong>13</strong> And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  <strong>14</strong> And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?  <strong>15</strong> And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy.

And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:  <strong>5</strong> But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.

And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.  <strong>8</strong> And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?

both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.  <strong>8</strong> But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.  <strong>10</strong> And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  <strong>11</strong> The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.  <strong>12</strong> And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.  <strong>13</strong> And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.  <strong>14</strong> Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.  <strong>15</strong> And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of:  The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.  <strong>16</strong> A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with  lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.  <strong>17</strong> And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.  <strong>18</strong> But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.  <strong>19</strong> And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort  shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.  <strong>20</strong> Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.  <strong>21</strong> And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.  <strong>22</strong> Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.  <strong>1</strong> And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.  <strong>2</strong> Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.  <strong>3</strong> Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.  <strong>4</strong> For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.  <strong>5</strong> And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.  <strong>6</strong> And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.  <strong>7</strong> And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.  <strong>8</strong> Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,  <strong>9</strong> There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.  <strong>10</strong> And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.  <strong>11</strong> In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  <strong>12</strong> And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.  <strong>13</strong> In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;  <strong>14</strong> They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.  <strong>15</strong> And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life.  <strong>16</strong> And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.  <strong>17</strong> And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.  <strong>18</strong> And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.  <strong>19</strong> And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.  <strong>20</strong> Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.  <strong>21</strong> And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:  <strong>22</strong> All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.  <strong>23</strong> And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.  <strong>24</strong> And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
