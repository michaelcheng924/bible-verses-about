by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.  <strong>8</strong> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  <strong>9</strong> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:  <strong>10</strong> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  <strong>11</strong> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  <strong>13</strong> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  <strong>14</strong> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.  <strong>15</strong> And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.  <strong>16</strong> But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  <strong>17</strong> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  <strong>18</strong> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  <strong>19</strong> Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  <strong>20</strong> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  <strong>21</strong> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph;

that they might obtain a better resurrection:  <strong>36</strong> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  <strong>37</strong> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  <strong>38</strong> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  <strong>39</strong> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  <strong>40</strong> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.  <strong>12</strong> So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.  <strong>13</strong> For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.  <strong>14</strong> What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?  <strong>15</strong> If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,  <strong>16</strong> And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?  <strong>17</strong> Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.  <strong>18</strong> Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.  <strong>19</strong> Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.  <strong>20</strong> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?  <strong>21</strong> Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?  <strong>22</strong> Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?  <strong>23</strong> And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.  <strong>24</strong> Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.  <strong>25</strong> Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?  <strong>26</strong> For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.  <strong>1</strong> My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.  <strong>2</strong> For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.  <strong>3</strong> Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.  <strong>4</strong> Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.  <strong>5</strong> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!  <strong>6</strong> And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.  <strong>7</strong> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:  <strong>8</strong> But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.  <strong>9</strong> Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.  <strong>10</strong> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.  <strong>11</strong> Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water  and bitter?  <strong>12</strong> Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.  <strong>13</strong> Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.  <strong>14</strong> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.  <strong>15</strong> This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.  <strong>16</strong> For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.  <strong>17</strong> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.  <strong>18</strong> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.

And he divided unto them his living.  <strong>13</strong> And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.  <strong>14</strong> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.  <strong>15</strong> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.  <strong>16</strong> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.  <strong>17</strong> And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!  <strong>18</strong> I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,  <strong>19</strong> And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.  <strong>20</strong> And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.  <strong>21</strong> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.  <strong>22</strong> But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:  <strong>23</strong> And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:  <strong>24</strong> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.  <strong>25</strong> Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.  <strong>26</strong> And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.  <strong>27</strong> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.  <strong>28</strong> And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.  <strong>29</strong> And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:  <strong>30</strong> But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.  <strong>31</strong> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.  <strong>32</strong> It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. <strong>1</strong> And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.  <strong>2</strong> And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.  <strong>3</strong> Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.  <strong>4</strong> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.  <strong>5</strong> So he called every one of his lord’s debtors unto him,  and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?  <strong>6</strong> And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  <strong>7</strong> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.  <strong>8</strong> And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.  <strong>9</strong> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.  <strong>10</strong> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.  <strong>11</strong> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  <strong>12</strong> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own? <strong>13</strong>           No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  <strong>14</strong> And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.  <strong>15</strong> And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.  <strong>16</strong> The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.  <strong>17</strong> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.  <strong>18</strong> Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her  husband committeth adultery. <strong>19</strong>           There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:  <strong>20</strong> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,  <strong>21</strong> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.  <strong>22</strong> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;  <strong>23</strong> And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.  <strong>24</strong> And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.  <strong>25</strong> But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.  <strong>26</strong> And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.  <strong>27</strong> Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:  <strong>28</strong> For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.  <strong>29</strong> Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.  <strong>30</strong> And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.  <strong>31</strong> And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the tax collectors and \"sinners\" were all gathering around to hear him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, \"This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Jesus told them this parable: <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them.
