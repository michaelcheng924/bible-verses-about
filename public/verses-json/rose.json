","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The angel said to the women, \"Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Suddenly Jesus met them. \"Greetings,\" he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> telling them, \"You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then Jesus came to them and said, \"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\" "}]}
