I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark-you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Noah did everything just as God commanded him.

They had no sons; so only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the Tent of Meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> They are to take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to death.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD also said to Moses, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether man or animal. They are to be mine. I am the LORD.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of the LORD. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi.

The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the Tent of Meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The total number of Levites counted at the LORD's command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses, \"Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am the LORD.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD commanded him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The LORD also said to Moses, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock.
