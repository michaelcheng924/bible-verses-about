He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v18002004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin!

for he giveth not account of any of his matters.  <strong>14</strong> For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.  <strong>15</strong> In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;  <strong>16</strong> Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,  <strong>17</strong> That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.  <strong>18</strong> He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.  <strong>19</strong> He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:  <strong>20</strong> So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.  <strong>21</strong> His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.  <strong>22</strong> Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.  <strong>23</strong> If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:  <strong>24</strong> Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.  <strong>25</strong> His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:  <strong>26</strong> He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.  <strong>27</strong> He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;  <strong>28</strong> He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.  <strong>29</strong> Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,  <strong>30</strong> To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.  <strong>31</strong> Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.  <strong>32</strong> If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.  <strong>33</strong> If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.  <strong>1</strong> Furthermore Elihu answered and said,  <strong>2</strong> Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.  <strong>3</strong> For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.  <strong>4</strong> Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.  <strong>5</strong> For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.  <strong>6</strong> Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.  <strong>7</strong> What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?  <strong>8</strong> Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.  <strong>9</strong> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.  <strong>11</strong> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.  <strong>12</strong> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.  <strong>13</strong> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?  <strong>14</strong> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;  <strong>15</strong> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.  <strong>16</strong> If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.  <strong>17</strong> Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?  <strong>18</strong> Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?  <strong>19</strong> How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are  the work of his hands.  <strong>20</strong> In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.  <strong>21</strong> For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.  <strong>22</strong> There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.  <strong>23</strong> For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.  <strong>24</strong> He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them  in the night, so that they are destroyed.  <strong>26</strong> He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;  <strong>27</strong> Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:  <strong>28</strong> So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.  <strong>29</strong> When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done  against a nation, or against a man only:  <strong>30</strong> That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.  <strong>31</strong> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement,  I will not offend any more:  <strong>32</strong> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.  <strong>33</strong> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.  <strong>34</strong> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.  <strong>35</strong> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.  <strong>36</strong> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.  <strong>37</strong> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands  among us, and multiplieth his words against God.  <strong>1</strong> Elihu spake moreover, and said,  <strong>2</strong> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s?  <strong>3</strong> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,  What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?  <strong>4</strong> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.  <strong>5</strong> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which  are higher than thou.  <strong>6</strong> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?  <strong>7</strong> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?  <strong>8</strong> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.  <strong>9</strong> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed  to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.  <strong>10</strong> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;  <strong>11</strong> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?  <strong>12</strong> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.  <strong>13</strong> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.  <strong>14</strong> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.  <strong>15</strong> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:  <strong>16</strong> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.  <strong>1</strong> Elihu also proceeded, and said,  <strong>2</strong> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf.  <strong>3</strong> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.  <strong>4</strong> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.  <strong>5</strong> Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is  mighty in strength and wisdom.  <strong>6</strong> He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.  <strong>7</strong> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.  <strong>8</strong> And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;  <strong>9</strong> Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.  <strong>10</strong> He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.  <strong>11</strong> If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.  <strong>12</strong> But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.  <strong>13</strong> But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.  <strong>14</strong> They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.  <strong>15</strong> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.  <strong>16</strong> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into  a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.  <strong>17</strong> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.  <strong>18</strong> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.  <strong>19</strong> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.  <strong>20</strong> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.  <strong>21</strong> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.  <strong>22</strong> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?  <strong>23</strong> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?  <strong>24</strong> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.  <strong>25</strong> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.  <strong>26</strong> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.  <strong>27</strong> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:  <strong>28</strong> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.  <strong>29</strong> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?  <strong>30</strong> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.  <strong>31</strong> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.  <strong>32</strong> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine  by the cloud that cometh betwixt.  <strong>33</strong> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.  <strong>1</strong> At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.  <strong>2</strong> Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that  goeth out of his mouth.  <strong>3</strong> He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.  <strong>4</strong> After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.  <strong>5</strong> God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.  <strong>6</strong> For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.  <strong>7</strong> He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.  <strong>8</strong> Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.  <strong>9</strong> Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.  <strong>10</strong> By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.  <strong>11</strong> Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:  <strong>12</strong> And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.  <strong>13</strong> He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.  <strong>14</strong> Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.  <strong>15</strong> Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?  <strong>16</strong> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?  <strong>17</strong> How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
