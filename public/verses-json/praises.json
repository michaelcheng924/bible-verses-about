outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.  <strong>9</strong> Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.  <strong>10</strong> Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.  <strong>11</strong> Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.  <strong>12</strong> They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.  <strong>13</strong> The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
