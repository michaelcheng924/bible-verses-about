And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.  <strong>19</strong> Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.  <strong>20</strong> Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.  <strong>21</strong> I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.  <strong>22</strong> Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.  <strong>23</strong> Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.  <strong>24</strong> Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.  <strong>25</strong> Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give the people these instructions, too, so that no one may be open to blame. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For the Scripture says, \"Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain,\" and \"The worker deserves his wages.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The sins of some men are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden.

It is  not good to have respect of persons in judgment.  <strong>24</strong> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:  <strong>25</strong> But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.  <strong>26</strong> Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.  <strong>27</strong> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.  <strong>28</strong> Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.  <strong>29</strong> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.  <strong>30</strong> I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;  <strong>31</strong> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.  <strong>32</strong> Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.  <strong>33</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>34</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.

Further Sayings of the Wise <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good: <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Whoever says to the guilty, \"You are innocent\"- peoples will curse him and nations denounce him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not say, \"I'll do to him as he has done to me; I'll pay that man back for what he did.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> I went past the field of the sluggard, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw: <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.
