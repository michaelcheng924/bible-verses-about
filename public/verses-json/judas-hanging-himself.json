Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:  <strong>2</strong> I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:  <strong>3</strong> Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.  <strong>4</strong> My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;  <strong>5</strong> Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.  <strong>6</strong> And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:  <strong>7</strong> Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.  <strong>8</strong> Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?  <strong>9</strong> I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>10</strong> Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.  <strong>11</strong> And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them  to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.  <strong>12</strong> Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,  <strong>13</strong> At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.  <strong>14</strong> And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.  <strong>15</strong> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.  <strong>16</strong> But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;  <strong>17</strong> Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,  <strong>18</strong> To open their eyes, and to turn them  from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.  <strong>19</strong> Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:  <strong>20</strong> But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.  <strong>21</strong> For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.  <strong>22</strong> Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:  <strong>23</strong> That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.  <strong>24</strong> And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.  <strong>25</strong> But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.  <strong>26</strong> For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.  <strong>27</strong> King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets?

And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.  <strong>9</strong> And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.  <strong>10</strong> And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.  <strong>11</strong> And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.  <strong>12</strong> And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,  <strong>13</strong> Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.  <strong>14</strong> And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.  <strong>15</strong> For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.  <strong>16</strong> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;  <strong>18</strong> And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.  <strong>19</strong> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:  <strong>20</strong> And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.  <strong>21</strong> And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.  <strong>22</strong> And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.  <strong>23</strong> And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,  <strong>24</strong> The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.  <strong>25</strong> And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?  <strong>26</strong> When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.  <strong>27</strong> Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.  <strong>28</strong> And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.  <strong>29</strong> Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.  <strong>30</strong> On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.

Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> as also the high priest and all the Council can testify.

I asked. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"'Get up,' the Lord said, 'and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.'

Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.' <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and saw the Lord speaking. 'Quick!' he said to me. 'Leave Jerusalem immediately, because they will not accept your testimony about me.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"'Lord,' I replied, 'these men know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Then the Lord said to me, 'Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, \"Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, \"Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. \"What are you going to do?\" he asked. \"This man is a Roman citizen.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The commander went to Paul and asked, \"Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?Yes, I am,\" he answered. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the commander said, \"I had to pay a big price for my citizenship.But I was born a citizen,\" Paul replied. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.
