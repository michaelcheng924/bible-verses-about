And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;  <strong>12</strong> Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.  <strong>13</strong> And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.  <strong>14</strong> But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.  <strong>15</strong> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.  <strong>16</strong> And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were  present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.  <strong>17</strong> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:  <strong>18</strong> And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.  <strong>19</strong> Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:  <strong>20</strong> But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.  <strong>21</strong> Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.  <strong>22</strong> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.  <strong>23</strong> And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

The rest of the men he sent back to their homes. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, \"Let the Hebrews hear!\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So all Israel heard the news: \"Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines.\" And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the men of Israel saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So he said, \"Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings. \"And Saul offered up the burnt offering. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"What have you done?\" asked Samuel. Saul replied, \"When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Micmash, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD's favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You acted foolishly,\" Samuel said. \"You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Micmash. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the desert. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, \"Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The price was two thirds of a shekel for sharpening plowshares and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash.

And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> David said to the young man who brought him the report, \"Where are you from?I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite,\" he answered. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David asked him, \"Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then David called one of his men and said, \"Go, strike him down!\" So he struck him down, and he died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For David had said to him, \"Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!\" "},{"_id":"616830afa3a86b670bc3015a","topicId":"616830aea3a86b670bc30157","verse":"1 Samuel 14:1-52","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p09014001_05-4\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v09014001-1\">14:1&nbsp;</b>One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah in the pomegranate cave at Migron. The people who were with him were about six hundred men, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Within the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014005_05-4\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish. Behold, I am with you heart and soul.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him.

The garrison and even the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014015_05-4\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was dispersing here and there. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count and see who has gone from us.” And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>So the LORD saved Israel that day.

See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found.

And the people were very faint. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014035_08-4\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>Therefore Saul said, “O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014042_08-4\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014043-1\">43&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014044-1\">44&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, “God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014045-1\">45&nbsp;</b>Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014046-1\">46&nbsp;</b>Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p09014046_12-4\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014047-1\">47&nbsp;</b>When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned he routed them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014048-1\">48&nbsp;</b>And he did valiantly and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014048_12-4\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014049-1\">49&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014050-1\">50&nbsp;</b>And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz.

And when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.  <strong>2</strong> And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were  about six hundred men;  <strong>3</strong> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.  <strong>4</strong> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.  <strong>5</strong> The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.  <strong>6</strong> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.  <strong>7</strong> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.  <strong>8</strong> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.  <strong>9</strong> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.  <strong>10</strong> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.  <strong>11</strong> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.  <strong>12</strong> And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.  <strong>13</strong> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.  <strong>14</strong> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which  a yoke of oxen might plow.  <strong>15</strong> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.  <strong>16</strong> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.  <strong>17</strong> Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.  <strong>18</strong> And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.  <strong>19</strong> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.  <strong>20</strong> And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.  <strong>21</strong> Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country  round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.  <strong>22</strong> Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.  <strong>23</strong> So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.  <strong>24</strong> And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.  <strong>25</strong> And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.  <strong>27</strong> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.  <strong>28</strong> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.  <strong>29</strong> Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.  <strong>30</strong> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?  <strong>31</strong> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.  <strong>32</strong> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.  <strong>33</strong> Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.  <strong>34</strong> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.  <strong>35</strong> And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.  <strong>36</strong> And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.  <strong>37</strong> And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.  <strong>38</strong> And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.  <strong>39</strong> For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.  <strong>40</strong> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.  <strong>41</strong> Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.  <strong>42</strong> And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.  <strong>43</strong> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.  <strong>44</strong> And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.  <strong>45</strong> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.  <strong>46</strong> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.  <strong>47</strong> So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.  <strong>48</strong> And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.  <strong>49</strong> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:  <strong>50</strong> And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.  <strong>51</strong> And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.  <strong>52</strong> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, \"Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.\" But he did not tell his father. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez, and the other Seneh. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One cliff stood to the north toward Micmash, the other to the south toward Geba. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, \"Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Do all that you have in mind,\" his armor-bearer said. \"Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Jonathan said, \"Come, then; we will cross over toward the men and let them see us. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has given them into our hands.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. \"Look!\" said the Philistines. \"The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, \"Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson.\" So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, \"Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then panic struck the whole army-those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties-and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Saul said to the men who were with him, \"Muster the forces and see who has left us.\" When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Saul said to Ahijah, \"Bring the ark of God.\" (At that time it was with the Israelites.) <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, \"Withdraw your hand.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So the LORD rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, \"Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!\" So none of the troops tasted food. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then one of the soldiers told him, \"Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be any man who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jonathan said, \"My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then someone said to Saul, \"Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it.You have broken faith,\" he said. \"Roll a large stone over here at once.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then he said, \"Go out among the men and tell them, 'Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'\" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Saul said, \"Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.Do whatever seems best to you,\" they replied. But the priest said, \"Let us inquire of God here.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> So Saul asked God, \"Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?\" But God did not answer him that day. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Saul therefore said, \"Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.\" But not one of the men said a word. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Saul then said to all the Israelites, \"You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.Do what seems best to you,\" the men replied. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, \"Give me the right answer.\" And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Saul said, \"Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.\" And Jonathan was taken. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then Saul said to Jonathan, \"Tell me what you have done.\" So Jonathan told him, \"I merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Saul said, \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But the men said to Saul, \"Should Jonathan die-he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help.\" So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side: Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul's army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.

But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you.

He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> but with righteousness he will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his place of rest will be glorious. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Cush, from Elam, from Babylonia, from Hamath and from the islands of the sea. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four quarters of the earth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Ephraim's jealousy will vanish, and Judah's enemies will be cut off; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, nor Judah hostile toward Ephraim. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west; together they will plunder the people to the east. They will lay hands on Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The LORD will dry up the gulf of the Egyptian sea; with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand over the Euphrates River. He will break it up into seven streams so that men can cross over in sandals. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> There will be a highway for the remnant of his people that is left from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from Egypt.

<strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.  <strong>27</strong> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.  <strong>28</strong> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.  <strong>29</strong> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.  <strong>30</strong> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.  <strong>31</strong> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"616830b6a3a86b670bc30170","topicId":"616830aea3a86b670bc30157","verse":"1 Kings 21:1-29","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p11021001_03-36\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v11021001-1\">21:1&nbsp;</b>Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11021002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And after this Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11021003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>But Naboth said to Ahab, “The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11021004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food.</p>\n<p id=\"p11021004_03-36\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11021005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, “Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11021006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And he said to her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ And he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11021007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do you now govern Israel?

He is no longer alive, but dead.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth's vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?'
