The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected-great quantities of gold and silver and clothing. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, they will have no rain. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The LORD will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> On that dayHOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the LORD's house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD Almighty.
