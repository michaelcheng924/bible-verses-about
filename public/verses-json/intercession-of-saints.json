He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from the angel's hand. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth.

A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: \"Woe! Woe!
