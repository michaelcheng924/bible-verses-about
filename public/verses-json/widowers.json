Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?

Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>Were you a bondservant when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is a freedman of the Lord.

Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007031_14-9\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007035_14-9\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry—it is no sin. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007038_14-9\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives.

But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!  <strong>25</strong> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>26</strong> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.  <strong>28</strong> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,  <strong>30</strong> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.  <strong>31</strong> But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. <strong>32</strong> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,  <strong>33</strong> Saying,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:  <strong>34</strong> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. <strong>35</strong> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.  <strong>36</strong> And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?  <strong>37</strong> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.  <strong>38</strong> But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  <strong>39</strong> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  <strong>40</strong> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.  <strong>41</strong> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.  <strong>42</strong> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  <strong>43</strong> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:  <strong>44</strong> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.  <strong>45</strong> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <strong>46</strong> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.  <strong>47</strong> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>48</strong> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>49</strong> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  <strong>50</strong> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  <strong>52</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"What did Moses command you?\" he replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They said, \"Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He answered, \"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, \"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \"Good teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good--except God alone. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" he declared, \"all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \"Who then can be saved?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Peter said to him, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus replied, \"no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"We are going up to Jerusalem,\" he said, \"and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" he asked. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They replied, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You don't know what you are asking,\" Jesus said. \"Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We can,\" they answered. Jesus said to them, \"You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" So they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him.
