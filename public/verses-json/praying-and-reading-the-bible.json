Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  <strong>8</strong> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.  <strong>9</strong> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  <strong>10</strong> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.  <strong>11</strong> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  <strong>13</strong> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  <strong>14</strong> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  <strong>15</strong> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  <strong>16</strong> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.  <strong>17</strong> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <strong>18</strong> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  <strong>19</strong> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  <strong>20</strong> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <strong>21</strong> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  <strong>22</strong> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  <strong>23</strong> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  <strong>24</strong> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  <strong>25</strong> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives? <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, \"Do not covet.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For in my inner being I delight in God's law; <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.
