mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.  <strong>3</strong> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with  all my ways.  <strong>4</strong> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.  <strong>5</strong> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.  <strong>6</strong>             Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.  <strong>7</strong> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?  <strong>8</strong> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. <strong>9</strong>             If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;  <strong>10</strong> Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.  <strong>11</strong> If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.  <strong>12</strong> Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.  <strong>13</strong> For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.  <strong>14</strong> I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.  <strong>15</strong> My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.  <strong>16</strong> Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.  <strong>17</strong> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!  <strong>18</strong>             If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.  <strong>19</strong> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.  <strong>20</strong> For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.  <strong>21</strong> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?  <strong>22</strong> I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.  <strong>23</strong> Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:  <strong>24</strong> And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> O LORD, you have searched me and you know me. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> You hem me in-behind and before; you have laid your hand upon me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If I say, \"Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place.
