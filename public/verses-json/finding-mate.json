And he said unto them,  <strong>24</strong>           Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.  <strong>25</strong> When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:  <strong>26</strong> Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.  <strong>27</strong> But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.  <strong>28</strong> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.  <strong>29</strong> And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.  <strong>30</strong> And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last. <strong>31</strong> The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.  <strong>32</strong> And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day  I shall be perfected.  <strong>33</strong> Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day  following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.  <strong>34</strong> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her  wings, and ye would not!  <strong>35</strong> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.  <strong>2</strong> And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy.  <strong>3</strong> And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?  <strong>4</strong> And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;  <strong>5</strong> And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?  <strong>6</strong> And they could not answer him again to these things.  <strong>7</strong> And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them,  <strong>8</strong> When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;  <strong>9</strong> And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.  <strong>10</strong> But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.  <strong>11</strong> For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. <strong>12</strong> Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.  <strong>13</strong> But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:  <strong>14</strong> And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. <strong>15</strong> And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.  <strong>16</strong> Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:  <strong>17</strong> And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.  <strong>18</strong> And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.  <strong>19</strong> And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused.  <strong>20</strong> And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.  <strong>21</strong> So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind.  <strong>22</strong> And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.  <strong>23</strong> And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.  <strong>24</strong> For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. <strong>25</strong> And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them,  <strong>26</strong> If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.

But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!  <strong>25</strong> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>26</strong> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.  <strong>28</strong> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,  <strong>30</strong> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.  <strong>31</strong> But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. <strong>32</strong> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,  <strong>33</strong> Saying,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:  <strong>34</strong> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. <strong>35</strong> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.  <strong>36</strong> And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?  <strong>37</strong> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.  <strong>38</strong> But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  <strong>39</strong> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  <strong>40</strong> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.  <strong>41</strong> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.  <strong>42</strong> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  <strong>43</strong> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:  <strong>44</strong> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.  <strong>45</strong> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <strong>46</strong> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.  <strong>47</strong> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>48</strong> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>49</strong> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  <strong>50</strong> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  <strong>52</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.  <strong>1</strong> And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,  <strong>2</strong> And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.  <strong>3</strong> And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither.  <strong>4</strong> And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.  <strong>5</strong> And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?  <strong>6</strong> And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.  <strong>7</strong> And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.  <strong>8</strong> And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.  <strong>9</strong> And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord:  <strong>10</strong> Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.  <strong>12</strong> And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:  <strong>13</strong> And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.  <strong>14</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.  <strong>15</strong> And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;  <strong>16</strong> And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.  <strong>17</strong> And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.  <strong>18</strong> And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.  <strong>19</strong> And when even was come, he went out of the city.  <strong>20</strong> And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.  <strong>21</strong> And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.  <strong>22</strong> And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.  <strong>23</strong> For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall havethem.  <strong>25</strong> And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.  <strong>26</strong> But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. <strong>27</strong> And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,  <strong>28</strong> And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.  <strong>30</strong> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.  <strong>31</strong> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?  <strong>32</strong> But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men  counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.  <strong>33</strong> And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"What did Moses command you?\" he replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They said, \"Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He answered, \"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.

room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  <strong>17</strong> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  <strong>18</strong> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.  <strong>19</strong> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.  <strong>20</strong> A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  <strong>21</strong> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.  <strong>22</strong> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  <strong>24</strong> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.  <strong>1</strong> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.  <strong>2</strong> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is  not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.  <strong>3</strong> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.  <strong>4</strong> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.  <strong>5</strong> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.  <strong>6</strong> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is  a friend to him that giveth gifts.  <strong>7</strong> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.  <strong>8</strong> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.  <strong>9</strong> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.  <strong>10</strong> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.  <strong>11</strong> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.  <strong>12</strong> The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.  <strong>13</strong> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.  <strong>14</strong> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the LORD.  <strong>15</strong> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.  <strong>16</strong> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but  he that despiseth his ways shall die.  <strong>17</strong> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
