Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  <strong>22</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "},{"_id":"616b638dede035c13f9328a6","topicId":"616b638aede035c13f93289f","verse":"John 17:17","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43017017_01-6\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43017017-1\">17&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.</span></p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>17</strong> Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  <strong>10</strong> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.  <strong>11</strong> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  <strong>12</strong> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  <strong>13</strong> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.  <strong>14</strong> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  <strong>15</strong> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  <strong>16</strong> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.  <strong>17</strong> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.  <strong>18</strong> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:  <strong>19</strong> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  <strong>20</strong> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <strong>22</strong> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  <strong>24</strong> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  <strong>25</strong> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:  <strong>26</strong> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then he said to his disciples, \"Let us go back to Judea.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"But Rabbi,\" they said, \"a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Are there not twelve hours of daylight?

But let us go to him.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, \"Let us also go, that we may die with him.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Lord,\" Martha said to Jesus, \"if you had been here, my brother would not have died. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Martha answered, \"I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she told him, \"I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. \"The Teacher is here,\" she said, \"and is asking for you.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Where have you laid him?\" he asked. \"Come and see, Lord,\" they replied. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus wept. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Take away the stone,\" he said. \"But, Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"What are we accomplishing?\" they asked. \"Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, \"You know nothing at all! <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> So from that day on they plotted to take his life. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, \"What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.

can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?  <strong>5</strong> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>6</strong> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  <strong>7</strong> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  <strong>8</strong> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  <strong>9</strong> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?  <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  <strong>11</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.  <strong>12</strong> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"616b6393ede035c13f9328b8","topicId":"616b638aede035c13f93289f","verse":"John 5:39","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43005039_01-26\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43005039-1\">39&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me,</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>39</strong>           Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
