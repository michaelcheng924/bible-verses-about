It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you.

If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be  they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.  <strong>20</strong> Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.  <strong>22</strong> And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.  <strong>23</strong> The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed.  <strong>24</strong> And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.  <strong>25</strong> Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, \"Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search there for David. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, \"Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?I'll go with you,\" said Abishai. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Abishai said to David, \"Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him twice.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But David said to Abishai, \"Don't destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the LORD's anointed and be guiltless? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD lives,\" he said, \"the LORD himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the LORD forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the LORD had put them into a deep sleep. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, \"Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?\" Abner replied, \"Who are you who calls to the king?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> David said, \"You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> What you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, you and your men deserve to die, because you did not guard your master, the LORD's anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Saul recognized David's voice and said, \"Is that your voice, David my son?\" David replied, \"Yes it is, my lord the king.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And he added, \"Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have now driven me from my share in the LORD's inheritance and have said, 'Go, serve other gods.' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea-as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Saul said, \"I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have erred greatly.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Here is the king's spear,\" David answered. \"Let one of your young men come over and get it. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD's anointed. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then Saul said to David, \"May you be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and surely triumph.\" So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.

 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
