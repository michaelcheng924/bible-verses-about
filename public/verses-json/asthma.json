And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.  <strong>19</strong> And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  <strong>20</strong> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.  <strong>21</strong> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)  <strong>22</strong> Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye  men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.  <strong>23</strong> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.  <strong>24</strong> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  <strong>25</strong> Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  <strong>26</strong> And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;  <strong>27</strong> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  <strong>28</strong> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.  <strong>29</strong> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.  <strong>30</strong> And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:  <strong>31</strong> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof  he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.  <strong>32</strong> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.  <strong>33</strong> So Paul departed from among them.  <strong>34</strong> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.  <strong>1</strong> After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;  <strong>2</strong> And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.  <strong>3</strong> And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.  <strong>4</strong> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.  <strong>5</strong> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was  Christ.  <strong>6</strong> And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his  raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.  <strong>7</strong> And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.  <strong>8</strong> And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.  <strong>9</strong> Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:  <strong>10</strong> For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.  <strong>11</strong> And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.  <strong>12</strong> And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,  <strong>13</strong> Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.  <strong>14</strong> And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye  Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:  <strong>15</strong> But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.  <strong>16</strong> And he drave them from the judgment seat.  <strong>17</strong> Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.  <strong>18</strong> And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.  <strong>19</strong> And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.  <strong>20</strong> When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;  <strong>21</strong> But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.  <strong>22</strong> And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.  <strong>23</strong> And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.  <strong>24</strong> And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.  <strong>25</strong> This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.  <strong>26</strong> And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.  <strong>27</strong> And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:  <strong>28</strong> For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,  <strong>2</strong> He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.  <strong>3</strong> And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.  <strong>4</strong> Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.  <strong>5</strong> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  <strong>6</strong> And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.  <strong>7</strong> And all the men were about twelve.  <strong>8</strong> And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.  <strong>9</strong> But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.  <strong>10</strong> And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.  <strong>11</strong> And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:  <strong>12</strong> So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.  <strong>13</strong> Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.  <strong>14</strong> And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and  chief of the priests, which did so.  <strong>15</strong> And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?  <strong>16</strong> And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  <strong>17</strong> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  <strong>18</strong> And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.  <strong>19</strong> Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.  <strong>20</strong> So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.  <strong>21</strong> After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.  <strong>22</strong> So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.  <strong>23</strong> And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.  <strong>24</strong> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;  <strong>25</strong> Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.  <strong>26</strong> Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:  <strong>27</strong> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.  <strong>28</strong> And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  <strong>29</strong> And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.  <strong>30</strong> And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.  <strong>31</strong> And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.  <strong>32</strong> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.  <strong>33</strong> And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.  <strong>34</strong> But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  <strong>35</strong> And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye  men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?  <strong>36</strong> Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.  <strong>37</strong> For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.  <strong>38</strong> Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.  <strong>39</strong> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.  <strong>40</strong> For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.  <strong>41</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.  <strong>1</strong> And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.  <strong>2</strong> And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,  <strong>3</strong> And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.  <strong>4</strong> And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.  <strong>5</strong> These going before tarried for us at Troas.  <strong>6</strong> And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.  <strong>7</strong> And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.  <strong>8</strong> And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.  <strong>9</strong> And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.  <strong>10</strong> And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.  <strong>11</strong> When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.  <strong>12</strong> And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.  <strong>13</strong> And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.  <strong>14</strong> And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.  <strong>15</strong> And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we came to Miletus.  <strong>16</strong> For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.  <strong>17</strong> And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.  <strong>18</strong> And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,  <strong>19</strong> Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:  <strong>20</strong> And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house,  <strong>21</strong> Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong>22</strong> And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:  <strong>23</strong> Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.  <strong>24</strong> But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.  <strong>25</strong> And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.  <strong>26</strong> Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.  <strong>27</strong> For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.  <strong>28</strong> Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.  <strong>29</strong> For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.  <strong>30</strong> Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.  <strong>31</strong> Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.  <strong>32</strong> And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.  <strong>33</strong> I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.  <strong>34</strong> Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.  <strong>35</strong> I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. <strong>36</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.  <strong>37</strong> And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,  <strong>38</strong> Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day  following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:  <strong>2</strong> And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.  <strong>3</strong> Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.  <strong>4</strong> And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.  <strong>5</strong> And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.  <strong>6</strong> And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.  <strong>7</strong> And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.  <strong>8</strong> And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.  <strong>9</strong> And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.  <strong>10</strong> And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.  <strong>11</strong> And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him  into the hands of the Gentiles.  <strong>12</strong> And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.  <strong>13</strong> Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.  <strong>14</strong> And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.  <strong>15</strong> And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.  <strong>16</strong> There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.  <strong>17</strong> And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.  <strong>18</strong> And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.  <strong>19</strong> And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.  <strong>20</strong> And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:  <strong>21</strong> And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.  <strong>22</strong> What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.  <strong>23</strong> Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;  <strong>24</strong> Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.  <strong>25</strong> As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and  concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.  <strong>26</strong> Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.  <strong>27</strong> And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,  <strong>28</strong> Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.  <strong>29</strong> (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)  <strong>30</strong> And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.  <strong>31</strong> And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.  <strong>32</strong> Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.  <strong>33</strong> Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.  <strong>34</strong> And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.  <strong>35</strong> And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.  <strong>36</strong> For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.  <strong>37</strong> And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?  <strong>38</strong> Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?  <strong>39</strong> But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.  <strong>40</strong> And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,  <strong>1</strong> Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make  now unto you.  <strong>2</strong> (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence: and he saith,)  <strong>3</strong> I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.  <strong>4</strong> And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.  <strong>5</strong> As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.  <strong>6</strong> And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.  <strong>7</strong> And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <strong>8</strong> And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.  <strong>9</strong> And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.  <strong>10</strong> And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.  <strong>11</strong> And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.  <strong>12</strong> And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,  <strong>13</strong> Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.  <strong>14</strong> And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.  <strong>15</strong> For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.  <strong>16</strong> And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;  <strong>18</strong> And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.  <strong>19</strong> And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:  <strong>20</strong> And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.  <strong>21</strong> And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.  <strong>22</strong> And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.  <strong>23</strong> And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,  <strong>24</strong> The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.  <strong>25</strong> And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?  <strong>26</strong> When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.  <strong>27</strong> Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.  <strong>28</strong> And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.  <strong>29</strong> Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.  <strong>30</strong> On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.  <strong>1</strong> And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.  <strong>2</strong> And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.  <strong>3</strong> Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?  <strong>4</strong> And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?  <strong>5</strong> Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.  <strong>6</strong> But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.  <strong>7</strong> And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.  <strong>8</strong> For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.  <strong>9</strong> And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.  <strong>10</strong> And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him  into the castle.  <strong>11</strong> And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.  <strong>12</strong> And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.  <strong>13</strong> And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.  <strong>14</strong> And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.  <strong>15</strong> Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.  <strong>16</strong> And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.  <strong>17</strong> Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.  <strong>18</strong> So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.  <strong>19</strong> Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him  aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?  <strong>20</strong> And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.  <strong>21</strong> But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.  <strong>22</strong> So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.  <strong>23</strong> And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;  <strong>24</strong> And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.  <strong>25</strong> And he wrote a letter after this manner:  <strong>26</strong> Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth  greeting.  <strong>27</strong> This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.  <strong>28</strong> And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:  <strong>29</strong> Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.  <strong>30</strong> And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.  <strong>31</strong> Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.  <strong>32</strong> On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:  <strong>33</strong> Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.  <strong>34</strong> And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;  <strong>35</strong> I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.  <strong>1</strong> And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.  <strong>2</strong> And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,  saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,  <strong>3</strong> We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.  <strong>4</strong> Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.  <strong>5</strong> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:  <strong>6</strong> Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.  <strong>7</strong> But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,  <strong>8</strong> Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.  <strong>9</strong> And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.  <strong>10</strong> Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:  <strong>11</strong> Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.  <strong>12</strong> And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:  <strong>13</strong> Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.  <strong>14</strong> But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:  <strong>15</strong> And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.  <strong>16</strong> And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.  <strong>17</strong> Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.  <strong>18</strong> Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.  <strong>19</strong> Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.  <strong>20</strong> Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,  <strong>21</strong> Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.  <strong>22</strong> And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.  <strong>23</strong> And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him  have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.  <strong>24</strong> And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.  <strong>25</strong> And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.  <strong>26</strong> He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.  <strong>27</strong> But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.  <strong>1</strong> Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.  <strong>2</strong> Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,  <strong>3</strong> And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.  <strong>4</strong> But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.  <strong>5</strong> Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.  <strong>6</strong> And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.  <strong>7</strong> And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.  <strong>8</strong> While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.  <strong>9</strong> But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?  <strong>10</strong> Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.  <strong>11</strong> For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.  <strong>12</strong> Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.  <strong>13</strong> And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.  <strong>14</strong> And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:  <strong>15</strong> About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.  <strong>16</strong> To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.  <strong>18</strong> Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:  <strong>19</strong> But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.  <strong>20</strong> And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him  whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.  <strong>21</strong> But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.  <strong>22</strong> Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.  <strong>23</strong> And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.  <strong>24</strong> And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.  <strong>25</strong> But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.  <strong>26</strong> Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.  <strong>27</strong> For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. \"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ, \"he said. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: \"These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, \"What is this babbler trying to say?\" Others remarked, \"He seems to be advocating foreign gods.\" They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, \"May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \"Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:|sc TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.
