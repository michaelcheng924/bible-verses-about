Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.  <strong>13</strong> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.  <strong>15</strong> And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.  <strong>16</strong> And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.  <strong>17</strong> And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.  <strong>18</strong> And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.  <strong>19</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.  <strong>20</strong> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.  <strong>21</strong> And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  <strong>22</strong> And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.  <strong>23</strong> For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  <strong>24</strong> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off.

Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, \"There is the sound of war in the camp.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Moses replied: \"It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to Aaron, \"What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Do not be angry, my lord,\" Aaron answered. \"You know how prone these people are to evil. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, \"Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.\" And all the Levites rallied to him. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then he said to them, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then Moses said, \"You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The next day Moses said to the people, \"You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So Moses went back to the LORD and said, \"Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But now, please forgive their sin-but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The LORD replied to Moses, \"Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
