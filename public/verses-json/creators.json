Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  <strong>22</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree.

And he went in to tarry with them.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.  <strong>31</strong> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.  <strong>32</strong> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?  <strong>33</strong> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,  <strong>34</strong> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.  <strong>35</strong> And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.  <strong>36</strong> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.  <strong>37</strong> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?  <strong>39</strong> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.  <strong>40</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.  <strong>41</strong> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?  <strong>42</strong> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.  <strong>43</strong> And he took it, and did eat before them.  <strong>44</strong> And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.  <strong>45</strong> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,  <strong>46</strong> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:  <strong>47</strong> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.  <strong>48</strong> And ye are witnesses of these things. <strong>49</strong>           And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.  <strong>50</strong> And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.  <strong>51</strong> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.  <strong>52</strong> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:  <strong>53</strong> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \"Why do you look for the living among the dead? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then they remembered his words. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but they were kept from recognizing him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He asked them, \"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \"Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"What things?\" he asked. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and he took it and ate it in their presence. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He said to them, \"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He told them, \"This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> You are witnesses of these things. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
