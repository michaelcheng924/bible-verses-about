trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:  <strong>13</strong> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.  <strong>14</strong> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.  <strong>15</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.  <strong>16</strong> But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.  <strong>17</strong> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.  <strong>18</strong> And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.  <strong>19</strong> For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.  <strong>20</strong> And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:  <strong>21</strong> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is  the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.  <strong>22</strong> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.  <strong>23</strong> Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.  <strong>24</strong> The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.  <strong>25</strong> And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.  <strong>26</strong> Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with  his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:  <strong>28</strong> And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.  <strong>29</strong> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.  <strong>30</strong> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.  <strong>31</strong> For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.  <strong>32</strong> And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.  <strong>33</strong> For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.  <strong>1</strong> Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!  <strong>2</strong> Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.  <strong>3</strong> Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.  <strong>4</strong> For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.  <strong>5</strong> As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will preserve it. <strong>6</strong> Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply revolted.  <strong>7</strong> For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.  <strong>8</strong> Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be discomfited.  <strong>9</strong> And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.  <strong>1</strong> Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.  <strong>2</strong> And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.  <strong>3</strong> And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.  <strong>4</strong> The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.  <strong>5</strong> The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.  <strong>6</strong> For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.  <strong>7</strong> The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.  <strong>8</strong> But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he stand.  <strong>9</strong> Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.  <strong>10</strong> Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.  <strong>11</strong> Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your  loins.  <strong>12</strong> They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.  <strong>13</strong> Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:  <strong>14</strong> Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;  <strong>15</strong> Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.  <strong>16</strong> Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in the fruitful field.  <strong>17</strong> And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.  <strong>18</strong> And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;  <strong>19</strong> When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low in a low place.  <strong>20</strong> Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.  <strong>1</strong> Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.  <strong>2</strong> O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.  <strong>3</strong> At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.  <strong>4</strong> And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.  <strong>5</strong> The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.  <strong>6</strong> And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and  strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.  <strong>7</strong> Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.  <strong>8</strong> The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.  <strong>9</strong> The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: \"Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: \"In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You said, 'No, we will flee on horses.' Therefore you will flee! You said, 'We will ride off on swift horses.' Therefore your pursuers will be swift! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; he rises to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, \"This is the way; walk in it.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then you will defile your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, \"Away with you!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is a consuming fire. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> His breath is like a rushing torrent, rising up to the neck. He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people go up with flutes to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The LORD will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria; with his scepter he will strike them down. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Every stroke the LORD lays on them with his punishing rod will be to the music of tambourines and harps, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king.

They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.

In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is a consuming fire. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> His breath is like a rushing torrent, rising up to the neck. He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people go up with flutes to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The LORD will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria; with his scepter he will strike them down. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Every stroke the LORD lays on them with his punishing rod will be to the music of tambourines and harps, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king.
