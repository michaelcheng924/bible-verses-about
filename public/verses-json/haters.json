Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace, was pleased <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Later I went to Syria and Cilicia. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They only heard the report: \"The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And they praised God because of me.
