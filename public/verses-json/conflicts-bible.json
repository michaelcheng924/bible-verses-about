And when any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him and say, “From what city are you?” And when he said, “Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10015003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man designated by the king to hear you.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10015004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom would say, “Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a dispute or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10015005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And whenever a man came near to pay homage to him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10015006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment.

So whatever you hear from the king’s house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10015036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son, and by them you shall send to me everything you hear.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10015037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.  <strong>2</strong> And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art  thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.  <strong>3</strong> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.  <strong>4</strong> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!  <strong>5</strong> And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him  to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.  <strong>6</strong> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.  <strong>8</strong> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.  <strong>10</strong> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.  <strong>11</strong> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were  called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.  <strong>12</strong> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.  <strong>14</strong> And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.  <strong>15</strong> And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.  <strong>16</strong> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.  <strong>17</strong> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.  <strong>18</strong> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.  <strong>19</strong> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art  a stranger, and also an exile.  <strong>20</strong> Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.  <strong>21</strong> And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.  <strong>22</strong> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.  <strong>23</strong> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.  <strong>24</strong> And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.  <strong>25</strong> And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:  <strong>26</strong> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am  I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.  <strong>27</strong> The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.  <strong>28</strong> See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.  <strong>29</strong> Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.  <strong>30</strong> And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.  <strong>31</strong> And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.  <strong>32</strong> And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:  <strong>33</strong> Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:  <strong>34</strong> But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.  <strong>35</strong> And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.  <strong>36</strong> Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.  <strong>37</strong> So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, \"What town are you from?\" He would answer, \"Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Absalom would say to him, \"Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And Absalom would add, \"If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that he gets justice.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the men of Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, \"Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the LORD. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow: 'If the LORD takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron. '\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The king said to him, \"Go in peace.\" So he went to Hebron. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, \"As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom's following kept on increasing. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> A messenger came and told David, \"The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, \"Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The king's officials answered him, \"Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So the king set out, with all the people following him, and they halted at a place some distance away. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The king said to Ittai the Gittite, \"Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your countrymen. May kindness and faithfulness be with you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But Ittai replied to the king, \"As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> David said to Ittai, \"Go ahead, march on.\" So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the desert. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then the king said to Zadok, \"Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the LORD's eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The king also said to Zadok the priest, \"Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of Abiathar. You and Abiathar take your two sons with you. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I will wait at the fords in the desert until word comes from you to inform me.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now David had been told, \"Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.\" So David prayed, \"O LORD, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> David said to him, \"If you go with me, you will be a burden to me. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; I was your father's servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,' then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's advice. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> So David's friend Hushai arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city. "}]}
