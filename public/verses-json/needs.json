to confusion.  <strong>2</strong> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.  <strong>3</strong> Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.  <strong>4</strong> Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.  <strong>5</strong> For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.  <strong>6</strong> By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.  <strong>7</strong> I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.  <strong>8</strong> Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with  thy honour all the day.  <strong>9</strong> Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.  <strong>10</strong> For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,  <strong>11</strong> Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him. <strong>12</strong> O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.  <strong>13</strong> Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.  <strong>14</strong> But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.  <strong>15</strong> My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof. <strong>16</strong> I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.  <strong>17</strong> O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.  <strong>18</strong> Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.  <strong>19</strong> Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!  <strong>20</strong>             Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.  <strong>21</strong> Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.  <strong>22</strong> I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.  <strong>23</strong> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.  <strong>24</strong> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and cruel men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I have become like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They say, \"God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Be not far from me, O God; come quickly, O my God, to help me. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But as for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> My mouth will tell of your righteousness, of your salvation all day long, though I know not its measure. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O Sovereign LORD; I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God, you who have done great things. Who, O God, is like you? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You will increase my honor and comfort me once again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you- I, whom you have redeemed. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.
