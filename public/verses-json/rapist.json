And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.  <strong>5</strong> And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.  <strong>6</strong> So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.  <strong>7</strong> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.  <strong>8</strong> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down.

Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.  <strong>14</strong> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.  <strong>15</strong> Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her.

But he would not hearken unto her.  <strong>17</strong> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.  <strong>18</strong> And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled.

And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.  <strong>35</strong> And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.  <strong>37</strong> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.  <strong>38</strong> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.  <strong>39</strong> And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He asked Amnon, \"Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?\" Amnon said to him, \"I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Go to bed and pretend to be ill,\" Jonadab said. \"When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, \"I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> David sent word to Tamar at the palace: \"Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. \"Send everyone out of here,\" Amnon said. So everyone left him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Amnon said to Tamar, \"Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.\" And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, \"Come to bed with me, my sister.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Don't, my brother!\" she said to him. \"Don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, \"Get up and get out!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No!\" she said to him. \"Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.\" But he refused to listen to her. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He called his personal servant and said, \"Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Her brother Absalom said to her, \"Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart.\" And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When King David heard all this, he was furious. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Absalom went to the king and said, \"Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"No, my son,\" the king replied. \"All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.\" Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Absalom said, \"If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.\" The king asked him, \"Why should he go with you?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Absalom ordered his men, \"Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> While they were on their way, the report came to David: \"Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, \"My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, \"I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jonadab said to the king, \"See, the king's sons are here; it has happened just as your servant said.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned for his son every day. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And the spirit of the king longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.

Only give me the girl as my wife.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob's sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They said to them, \"We can't do such a thing; we can't give our sister to a man who is not circumcised.

brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.  <strong>51</strong> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even  all wrought jewels.  <strong>52</strong> And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.  <strong>53</strong> (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)  <strong>54</strong> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Moses said to the people, \"Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites and to carry out the LORD's vengeance on them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba-the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Moses was angry with the officers of the army-the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds-who returned from the battle. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Have you allowed all the women to live?\" he asked them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"They were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and were the means of turning the Israelites away from the LORD in what happened at Peor, so that a plague struck the LORD's people. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"All of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, \"This is the requirement of the law that the LORD gave Moses: <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Divide the spoils between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the LORD one out of every five hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep or goats. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> From the Israelites' half, select one out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> 72,000 cattle, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> 61,000 donkeys <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The half share of those who fought in the battle was: 337,500 sheep, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> of which the tribute for the LORD was 675; <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> 36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the LORD was 72; <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> 30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the LORD was 61; <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> 16,000 people, of which the tribute for the LORD was 32. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD's part, as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men- <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> the community's half-was 337,500 sheep, <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> 36,000 cattle, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> 30,500 donkeys <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> and 16,000 people. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> From the Israelites' half, Moses selected one out of every fifty persons and animals, as the LORD commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD's tabernacle. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then the officers who were over the units of the army-the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds-went to Moses <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> and said to him, \"Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> So we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each of us acquired-armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces-to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold-all the crafted articles. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Each soldier had taken plunder for himself. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.

But none answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place.  <strong>29</strong> And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.  <strong>30</strong> And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your minds.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her father's house in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her father's house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> His father-in-law, the girl's father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, \"Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girl's father said, \"Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl's father said, \"Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!\" So the two of them ate together. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said, \"Now look, it's almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, \"Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> His master replied, \"No. We won't go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He added, \"Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, \"Where are you going? Where did you come from?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He answered, \"We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants-me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You are welcome at my house,\" the old man said. \"Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, \"Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The owner of the house went outside and said to them, \"No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Get up; let's go.\" But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Everyone who saw it said, \"Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!\" "},{"_id":"616a2461a03c6e96020b9320","topicId":"616a245ca03c6e96020b930e","verse":"Psalm 82:3","votes":127,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19082003_01-18\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19082003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Give justice to the weak and the fatherless;</span><br><span id=\"p19082003_01-18\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>3</strong> Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
