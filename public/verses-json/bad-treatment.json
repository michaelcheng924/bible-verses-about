judgment to the Gentiles.  <strong>2</strong> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.  <strong>3</strong> A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.  <strong>4</strong> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.  <strong>5</strong> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:  <strong>6</strong> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;  <strong>7</strong> To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.  <strong>8</strong> I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I

let them shout from the top of the mountains.  <strong>12</strong> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.  <strong>14</strong> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and  refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.  <strong>15</strong> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.  <strong>16</strong> And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.  <strong>17</strong> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.  <strong>18</strong> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.  <strong>19</strong> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD’S servant?  <strong>20</strong> Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.  <strong>22</strong> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are  all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.  <strong>23</strong> Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?  <strong>24</strong> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim his praise in the islands. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD will march out like a mighty man, like a warrior he will stir up his zeal; with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But those who trust in idols, who say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me, blind like the servant of the LORD? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You have seen many things, but have paid no attention; your ears are open, but you hear nothing.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It pleased the LORD for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, \"Send them back.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.

And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.  <strong>2</strong> And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.  <strong>3</strong> And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.  <strong>4</strong> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.  <strong>5</strong> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.  <strong>6</strong> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.  <strong>8</strong> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.  <strong>9</strong> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <strong>10</strong> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.  <strong>11</strong> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?  <strong>12</strong> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  <strong>13</strong> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.  <strong>14</strong> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.  <strong>15</strong> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.  <strong>16</strong> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:  <strong>17</strong> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.  <strong>18</strong> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.  <strong>19</strong> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  <strong>20</strong> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.  <strong>21</strong> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?  <strong>22</strong> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
