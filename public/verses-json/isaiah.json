","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands will put their hope.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> This is what God the LORD says- he who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and all that comes out of it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Let the desert and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim his praise in the islands. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD will march out like a mighty man, like a warrior he will stir up his zeal; with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But those who trust in idols, who say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me, blind like the servant of the LORD? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You have seen many things, but have paid no attention; your ears are open, but you hear nothing.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It pleased the LORD for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, \"Send them back.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.

Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> so that no one may boast before him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore, as it is written: \"Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.\" "},{"_id":"6164dd58dc1be0273f8b7488","topicId":"6164dd50dc1be0273f8b746f","verse":"John 21:1-25","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43021001_06-27\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v43021001-1\">21:1&nbsp;</b>After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and he revealed himself in this way. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"p43021003_06-27\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woc\">“Children, do you have any fish?”</span> They answered him, “No.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>He said to them, <span class=\"woc\">“Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”</span> So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>That disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.</p>\n<p id=\"p43021008_06-27\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woc\">“Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43021011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them.

They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  <strong>4</strong> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  <strong>5</strong> Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his  fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.  <strong>8</strong> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.  <strong>9</strong> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.  <strong>11</strong> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.  <strong>12</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  <strong>13</strong> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.  <strong>14</strong> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.  <strong>15</strong> So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.  <strong>16</strong> He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.  <strong>17</strong> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.  <strong>18</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.  <strong>19</strong> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>20</strong> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  <strong>21</strong> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?  <strong>22</strong> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.  <strong>23</strong> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?  <strong>24</strong> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.  <strong>25</strong> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"I'm going out to fish,\" Simon Peter told them, and they said, \"We'll go with you.\" So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He called out to them, \"Friends, haven't you any fish?No,\" they answered. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said, \"Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\" When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \"It is the Lord!\" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, \"It is the Lord,\" he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Bring some of the fish you have just caught.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Come and have breakfast.\" None of the disciples dared ask him, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?Yes, Lord,\" he said, \"you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my lambs.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again Jesus said, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me?\" He answered, \"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Take care of my sheep.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The third time he said to him, \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" He said, \"Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Feed my sheep. I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, \"Follow me!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, \"Lord, who is going to betray you?\") <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Peter saw him, he asked, \"Lord, what about him?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. "}]}
