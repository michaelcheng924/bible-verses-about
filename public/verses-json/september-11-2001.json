Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;  <strong>2</strong> And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.  <strong>3</strong> Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.  <strong>4</strong> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.  <strong>5</strong> For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD’S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.  <strong>7</strong> Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD’S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.  <strong>8</strong> Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.  <strong>9</strong> We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.  <strong>10</strong> The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.  <strong>11</strong> Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.  <strong>12</strong> Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.  <strong>15</strong> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.  <strong>16</strong> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.  <strong>17</strong> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  <strong>18</strong> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <strong>19</strong> The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is  the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>20</strong> Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;  <strong>21</strong> And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;  <strong>22</strong> With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;  <strong>23</strong> I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.  <strong>24</strong> And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.  <strong>25</strong> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.  <strong>28</strong> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.  <strong>29</strong> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.  <strong>30</strong> The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.  <strong>31</strong> One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,  <strong>32</strong> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.  <strong>33</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.  <strong>34</strong> Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.  <strong>35</strong> The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.  <strong>37</strong> And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.  <strong>38</strong> They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps.  <strong>39</strong> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.  <strong>40</strong> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.  <strong>41</strong> How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!  <strong>42</strong> The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.  <strong>43</strong> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.  <strong>44</strong> And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.  <strong>45</strong> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.  <strong>46</strong> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.  <strong>47</strong> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.  <strong>48</strong> Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.  <strong>49</strong> As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.  <strong>50</strong> Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.  <strong>51</strong> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house.  <strong>52</strong> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.  <strong>53</strong> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.  <strong>54</strong> A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:  <strong>55</strong> Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:  <strong>56</strong> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.  <strong>57</strong> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.  <strong>58</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.  <strong>59</strong> The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.  <strong>60</strong> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.  <strong>61</strong> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;  <strong>62</strong> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.  <strong>63</strong> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:  <strong>64</strong> And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are  the words of Jeremiah.

Do not spare her young men; completely destroy her army. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They will fall down slain in Babylon, fatally wounded in her streets. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the LORD Almighty, though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the LORD's vengeance; he will pay her what she deserves. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Babylon was a gold cup in the LORD's hand; she made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore they have now gone mad. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Wail over her! Get balm for her pain; perhaps she can be healed. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'We would have healed Babylon, but she cannot be healed; let us leave her and each go to his own land, for her judgment reaches to the skies, it rises as high as the clouds.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"'The LORD has vindicated us; come, let us tell in Zion what the LORD our God has done.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Sharpen the arrows, take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the kings of the Medes, because his purpose is to destroy Babylon. The LORD will take vengeance, vengeance for his temple. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Lift up a banner against the walls of Babylon! Reinforce the guard, station the watchmen, prepare an ambush! The LORD will carry out his purpose, his decree against the people of Babylon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures, your end has come, the time for you to be cut off. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn by himself: I will surely fill you with men, as with a swarm of locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"He made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Every man is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud; they have no breath in them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including the tribe of his inheritance- the LORD Almighty is his name. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You are my war club, my weapon for battle- with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> with you I shatter horse and rider, with you I shatter chariot and driver, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> with you I shatter man and woman, with you I shatter old man and youth, with you I shatter young man and maiden, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> with you I shatter shepherd and flock, with you I shatter farmer and oxen, with you I shatter governors and officials. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Before your eyes I will repay Babylon and all who live in Babylonia for all the wrong they have done in Zion,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I am against you, O destroying mountain, you who destroy the whole earth,\" declares the LORD. \"I will stretch out my hand against you, roll you off the cliffs, and make you a burned-out mountain. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> No rock will be taken from you for a cornerstone, nor any stone for a foundation, for you will be desolate forever,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Lift up a banner in the land! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Prepare the nations for battle against her; summon against her these kingdoms: Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander against her; send up horses like a swarm of locusts. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Prepare the nations for battle against her- the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their officials, and all the countries they rule. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The land trembles and writhes, for the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand- to lay waste the land of Babylon so that no one will live there. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Babylon's warriors have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted; they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire; the bars of her gates are broken. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One courier follows another and messenger follows messenger to announce to the king of Babylon that his entire city is captured, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> the river crossings seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers terrified.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"The Daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; the time to harvest her will soon come.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured us, he has thrown us into confusion, he has made us an empty jar. Like a serpent he has swallowed us and filled his stomach with our delicacies, and then has spewed us out. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> May the violence done to our flesh be upon Babylon,\" say the inhabitants of Zion. \"May our blood be on those who live in Babylonia,\" says Jerusalem. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says: \"See, I will defend your cause and avenge you; I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Babylon will be a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Her people all roar like young lions, they growl like lion cubs. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But while they are aroused, I will set out a feast for them and make them drunk, so that they shout with laughter- then sleep forever and not awake,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"How Sheshach will be captured, the boast of the whole earth seized! What a horror Babylon will be among the nations! <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Her towns will be desolate, a dry and desert land, a land where no one lives, through which no man travels. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. And the wall of Babylon will fall. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives! Run from the fierce anger of the LORD. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> For the time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced and her slain will all lie fallen within her. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"Babylon must fall because of Israel's slain, just as the slain in all the earth have fallen because of Babylon. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> You who have escaped the sword, leave and do not linger! Remember the LORD in a distant land, and think on Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD's house.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"But days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Even if Babylon reaches the sky and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> \"The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The LORD will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the LORD is a God of retribution; he will repay in full. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake,\" declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"Babylon's thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations' labor is only fuel for the flames.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> This is the message Jeremiah gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon-all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> He said to Seraiah, \"When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Then say, 'O LORD, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither man nor animal will live in it; it will be desolate forever.' <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Then say, 'So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring upon her. And her people will fall.'\" The words of Jeremiah end here.

mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.  <strong>5</strong> They come from a far

destruction from the Almighty.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man’s heart shall melt:  <strong>8</strong> And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.  <strong>10</strong> For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their

iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.  <strong>12</strong> I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than

the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.  <strong>20</strong> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.  <strong>21</strong> But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their

Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The LORD Almighty is mustering an army for war. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens- the LORD and the weapons of his wrath- to destroy the whole country. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Because of this, all hands will go limp, every man's heart will melt. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> See, the day of the LORD is coming -a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger- to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will make man scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives ravished. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the glory of the Babylonians' pride, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flocks there. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.

wander from thy commandments.  <strong>11</strong> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.  <strong>12</strong> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>13</strong> With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.  <strong>14</strong> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as  in all riches.  <strong>15</strong> I

Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.  <strong>37</strong> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.  <strong>38</strong> Stablish thy word

quickened me.  <strong>51</strong> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.  <strong>52</strong> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted

<strong>55</strong> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.  <strong>56</strong> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  <strong>57</strong>             Thou art my

my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.  <strong>60</strong> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.  <strong>61</strong> The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.  <strong>62</strong> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>63</strong> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.  <strong>64</strong> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>65</strong> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>66</strong> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.  <strong>67</strong> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.  <strong>68</strong> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.  <strong>69</strong> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  <strong>70</strong> Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.  <strong>71</strong>             It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.  <strong>72</strong> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.  <strong>73</strong> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  <strong>74</strong> They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.  <strong>75</strong> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  <strong>76</strong> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.  <strong>77</strong> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.  <strong>78</strong> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.  <strong>79</strong> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.  <strong>80</strong> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.  <strong>81</strong> My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.  <strong>82</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?  <strong>83</strong> For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.  <strong>84</strong> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  <strong>85</strong> The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.  <strong>86</strong> All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.  <strong>87</strong> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.  <strong>88</strong> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  <strong>89</strong> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.  <strong>90</strong> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.  <strong>91</strong> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.  <strong>92</strong> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.  <strong>93</strong> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.  <strong>94</strong> I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.  <strong>95</strong> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.  <strong>96</strong> I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.  <strong>97</strong> O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.  <strong>98</strong> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.  <strong>99</strong> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.  <strong>100</strong> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.  <strong>101</strong> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  <strong>102</strong> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.  <strong>103</strong> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!  <strong>104</strong> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  <strong>105</strong> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  <strong>106</strong> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  <strong>107</strong> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>108</strong> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  <strong>109</strong> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.  <strong>110</strong> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.  <strong>111</strong> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  <strong>112</strong> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.  <strong>113</strong> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.  <strong>114</strong> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.  <strong>115</strong> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.  <strong>116</strong> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  <strong>117</strong> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  <strong>118</strong> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.  <strong>119</strong> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.  <strong>120</strong> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  <strong>121</strong> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.  <strong>122</strong> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.  <strong>123</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.  <strong>124</strong> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>125</strong> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.  <strong>126</strong>             It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for  they have made void thy law.  <strong>127</strong> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.  <strong>128</strong> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning  all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  <strong>129</strong> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.  <strong>130</strong> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.  <strong>131</strong> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.  <strong>132</strong> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  <strong>133</strong> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  <strong>134</strong> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.  <strong>135</strong> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>136</strong> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  <strong>137</strong> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.  <strong>138</strong> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  <strong>139</strong> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  <strong>140</strong> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.  <strong>141</strong> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy

my delights.  <strong>144</strong> The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.  <strong>145</strong> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.  <strong>146</strong> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  <strong>147</strong> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.  <strong>148</strong> Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  <strong>149</strong> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  <strong>150</strong> They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.  <strong>151</strong> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are  truth.  <strong>152</strong> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.  <strong>153</strong> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.  <strong>154</strong> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.  <strong>155</strong> Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.  <strong>156</strong> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.  <strong>157</strong> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet  do I not decline from thy testimonies.  <strong>158</strong> I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.  <strong>159</strong> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.  <strong>160</strong> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  <strong>161</strong> Princes have persecuted me without a cause:

and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.  <strong>13</strong> And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,  <strong>14</strong> Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.  <strong>15</strong> And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.  <strong>16</strong> And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.  <strong>17</strong> And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.  <strong>18</strong> By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.  <strong>19</strong> For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.  <strong>20</strong> And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:  <strong>21</strong> Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They were not given power to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> During those days men will seek death, but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They had tails and stings like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the horns of the golden altar that is before God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, \"Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The number of the mounted troops was two hundred million. I heard their number. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this: Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The rest of mankind that were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood--idols that cannot see or hear or walk. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.

and brought me into darkness, but not into light.  <strong>3</strong> Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me  all the day.  <strong>4</strong> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.  <strong>5</strong> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.  <strong>6</strong> He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.  <strong>7</strong> He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.  <strong>8</strong> Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.  <strong>9</strong> He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.  <strong>10</strong> He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as  a lion in secret places.  <strong>11</strong> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.  <strong>12</strong> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.  <strong>13</strong> He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.  <strong>14</strong> I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.  <strong>15</strong> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.  <strong>16</strong> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.  <strong>17</strong> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.  <strong>18</strong> And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:  <strong>19</strong> Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.  <strong>20</strong> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.  <strong>21</strong> This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.  <strong>22</strong>           It is of the LORD’S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.  <strong>23</strong> They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.  <strong>24</strong> The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.  <strong>25</strong> The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.  <strong>26</strong> It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.  <strong>28</strong> He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.  <strong>29</strong> He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.  <strong>30</strong> He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.  <strong>31</strong> For the Lord will not cast off for ever:  <strong>32</strong> But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.  <strong>33</strong> For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.  <strong>34</strong> To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,  <strong>35</strong> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,  <strong>36</strong> To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.  <strong>37</strong> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?  <strong>38</strong> Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?  <strong>39</strong> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?  <strong>40</strong> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.  <strong>41</strong> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.  <strong>42</strong> We

covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.  <strong>45</strong> Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.  <strong>46</strong> All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.  <strong>47</strong> Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.  <strong>48</strong> Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.  <strong>49</strong> Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,  <strong>50</strong> Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.  <strong>51</strong> Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.  <strong>52</strong> Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.  <strong>53</strong> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.  <strong>54</strong> Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.  <strong>55</strong> I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.  <strong>56</strong> Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.  <strong>57</strong> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.  <strong>58</strong> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.  <strong>59</strong> O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.  <strong>60</strong> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.  <strong>61</strong> Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;  <strong>62</strong> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.  <strong>63</strong> Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.  <strong>64</strong> Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.  <strong>65</strong> Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.  <strong>66</strong> Persecute and destroy them in anger from

<sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Who can speak and have it happen if the Lord has not decreed it? <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that both calamities and good things come? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Why should any living man complain when punished for his sins? <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Let us examine our ways and test them, and let us return to the LORD. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven, and say: <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"We have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have covered yourself with anger and pursued us; you have slain without pity. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> You have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You have made us scum and refuse among the nations. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"All our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> We have suffered terror and pitfalls, ruin and destruction.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> My eyes will flow unceasingly, without relief, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me; <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> the waters closed over my head, and I thought I was about to be cut off. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> You heard my plea: \"Do not close your ears to my cry for relief.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> You came near when I called you, and you said, \"Do not fear.\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> O Lord, you took up my case; you redeemed my life. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me.

The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.  <strong>8</strong> The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.  <strong>9</strong> And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,  <strong>10</strong> The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;  <strong>12</strong> The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.  <strong>13</strong> For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day.  <strong>15</strong> The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.  <strong>16</strong> For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.  <strong>18</strong> For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.  <strong>19</strong> Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother.  <strong>20</strong> And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:  <strong>21</strong> Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.  <strong>1</strong> Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;  <strong>2</strong> To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that  they may rob the fatherless!  <strong>3</strong> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?  <strong>4</strong> Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.  <strong>5</strong> O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.  <strong>6</strong> I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.  <strong>7</strong> Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.  <strong>8</strong> For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?  <strong>9</strong> Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?  <strong>10</strong> As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;  <strong>11</strong> Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.  <strong>13</strong> For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it,  and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:  <strong>14</strong> And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.  <strong>15</strong> Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were  no wood.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.  <strong>17</strong> And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;  <strong>18</strong> And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth.  <strong>19</strong> And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.  <strong>20</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.  <strong>21</strong> The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.  <strong>22</strong> For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet  a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.  <strong>23</strong> For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the midst of all the land.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt.  <strong>25</strong> For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger in their destruction.  <strong>26</strong> And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was  upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.  <strong>27</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.  <strong>28</strong> He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up his carriages:  <strong>29</strong> They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.  <strong>30</strong> Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.  <strong>31</strong> Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.  <strong>32</strong> As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.  <strong>33</strong> Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.  <strong>34</strong> And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as men rejoice when dividing the plunder. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For as in the day of Midian's defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Lord has sent a message against Jacob; it will fall on Israel. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> All the people will know it- Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria- who say with pride and arrogance of heart, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars.\" "}]}
