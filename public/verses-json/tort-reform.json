Then Peter said, \"Look at us!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you.

Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When all the people saw him walking and praising God, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> While the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Peter saw this, he said to them: \"Men of Israel, why does this surprise you?
