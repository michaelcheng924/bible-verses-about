A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  <strong>15</strong> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  <strong>16</strong> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <strong>17</strong>           Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  <strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <strong>21</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  <strong>24</strong> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <strong>25</strong> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  <strong>26</strong> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <strong>27</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  <strong>28</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  <strong>29</strong> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>30</strong> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>31</strong> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  <strong>32</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <strong>33</strong>           Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  <strong>34</strong> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  <strong>35</strong> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  <strong>36</strong> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  <strong>37</strong> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <strong>38</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  <strong>39</strong> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  <strong>40</strong> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.  <strong>41</strong> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  <strong>42</strong> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <strong>43</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  <strong>44</strong> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  <strong>45</strong> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  <strong>46</strong> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  <strong>47</strong> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  <strong>48</strong> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. <strong>1</strong>           Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.  <strong>2</strong> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>3</strong> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  <strong>4</strong> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <strong>5</strong>           And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  <strong>7</strong> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  <strong>8</strong> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  <strong>9</strong> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  <strong>10</strong> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is  in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> Give us this day our daily bread.  <strong>12</strong> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  <strong>13</strong> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  <strong>14</strong> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:  <strong>15</strong> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <strong>16</strong>           Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>17</strong> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  <strong>18</strong> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  <strong>19</strong>           Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  <strong>20</strong> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:  <strong>21</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>22</strong> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  <strong>23</strong> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is  that darkness! <strong>24</strong>           No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  <strong>26</strong> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  <strong>27</strong> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  <strong>28</strong> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:  <strong>29</strong> And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  <strong>31</strong> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  <strong>32</strong> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  <strong>33</strong> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>34</strong> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. <strong>1</strong>           Judge not, that ye be not judged.  <strong>2</strong> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  <strong>3</strong> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  <strong>4</strong> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?  <strong>5</strong> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.  <strong>6</strong>           Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. <strong>7</strong>           Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:  <strong>8</strong> For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  <strong>9</strong> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?  <strong>10</strong> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  <strong>11</strong> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?  <strong>12</strong> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. <strong>13</strong>           Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:  <strong>14</strong> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is  the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. <strong>15</strong>           Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  <strong>16</strong> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  <strong>17</strong> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  <strong>18</strong> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  <strong>19</strong> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. <strong>21</strong>           Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>22</strong> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  <strong>23</strong> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <strong>24</strong>           Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:  <strong>25</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  <strong>26</strong> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:  <strong>27</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.  <strong>28</strong> And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:  <strong>29</strong> For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.  <strong>1</strong> When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.  <strong>2</strong> And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <strong>3</strong> And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  <strong>4</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <strong>5</strong> And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,  <strong>6</strong> And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.  <strong>7</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.  <strong>8</strong> The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.  <strong>9</strong> For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  <strong>10</strong> When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.  <strong>11</strong> And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>12</strong> But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>13</strong> And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.  <strong>14</strong> And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.  <strong>15</strong> And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.  <strong>16</strong> When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:  <strong>17</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  <strong>18</strong> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.  <strong>19</strong> And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  <strong>20</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.  <strong>21</strong> And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  <strong>22</strong> But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. <strong>23</strong> And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.  <strong>24</strong> And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.  <strong>25</strong> And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.  <strong>26</strong> And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.  <strong>27</strong> But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!  <strong>28</strong> And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.  <strong>29</strong> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?  <strong>30</strong> And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.  <strong>31</strong> So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.  <strong>32</strong> And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.  <strong>33</strong> And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.  <strong>34</strong> And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.  <strong>1</strong> And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.  <strong>2</strong> And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.  <strong>3</strong> And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.  <strong>4</strong> And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?  <strong>5</strong> For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  <strong>6</strong> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.  <strong>7</strong> And he arose, and departed to his house.  <strong>8</strong> But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.  <strong>9</strong> And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me.  And he arose, and followed him.  <strong>10</strong> And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.  <strong>11</strong> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?  <strong>12</strong> But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.  <strong>13</strong> But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. <strong>14</strong> Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?  <strong>15</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.  <strong>16</strong> No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.  <strong>17</strong> Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. <strong>18</strong> While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  <strong>19</strong> And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.  <strong>20</strong> And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:  <strong>21</strong> For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.  <strong>22</strong> But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.  <strong>23</strong> And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,  <strong>24</strong> He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.  <strong>25</strong> But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.  <strong>26</strong> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.  <strong>27</strong> And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.  <strong>28</strong> And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.  <strong>29</strong> Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.  <strong>30</strong> And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.  <strong>31</strong> But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.  <strong>32</strong> As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.  <strong>33</strong> And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.  <strong>34</strong> But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.  <strong>36</strong> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.  <strong>37</strong> Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is  plenteous, but the labourers are few;  <strong>38</strong> Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest. <strong>1</strong> And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.  <strong>2</strong> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;  <strong>3</strong> Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;  <strong>4</strong> Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  <strong>5</strong> These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:  <strong>6</strong> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  <strong>8</strong> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.  <strong>9</strong> Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,  <strong>10</strong> Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.  <strong>11</strong> And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.  <strong>12</strong> And when ye come into an house, salute it.  <strong>13</strong> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.  <strong>14</strong> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.  <strong>15</strong> Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. <strong>16</strong>           Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.  <strong>17</strong> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;  <strong>18</strong> And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.  <strong>19</strong> But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.  <strong>20</strong> For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.  <strong>21</strong> And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their  parents, and cause them to be put to death.  <strong>22</strong> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.  <strong>23</strong> But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.  <strong>24</strong> The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.  <strong>25</strong> It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?  <strong>26</strong> Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.  <strong>27</strong> What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.  <strong>28</strong> And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.  <strong>29</strong> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  <strong>30</strong> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  <strong>31</strong> Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.  <strong>32</strong> Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>33</strong> But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>34</strong> Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  <strong>35</strong> For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.  <strong>36</strong> And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.  <strong>37</strong> He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  <strong>38</strong> And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.  <strong>39</strong> He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. <strong>40</strong>           He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  <strong>41</strong> He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.  <strong>42</strong> And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.  <strong>2</strong> Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,  <strong>3</strong> And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?  <strong>4</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see:  <strong>5</strong> The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.  <strong>6</strong> And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. <strong>7</strong> And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?  <strong>8</strong> But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.  <strong>9</strong> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.  <strong>10</strong> For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  <strong>11</strong> Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  <strong>12</strong> And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.  <strong>13</strong> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.  <strong>14</strong> And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.  <strong>15</strong> He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. <strong>16</strong>           But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows,  <strong>17</strong> And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.  <strong>18</strong> For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.  <strong>19</strong> The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children. <strong>20</strong> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:  <strong>21</strong> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.  <strong>23</strong> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.  <strong>24</strong> But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee. <strong>25</strong> At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.  <strong>26</strong> Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.  <strong>27</strong> All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.  <strong>28</strong>           Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  <strong>29</strong> Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  <strong>30</strong> For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.  <strong>1</strong> At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.  <strong>2</strong> But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.  <strong>3</strong> But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him;  <strong>4</strong> How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?  <strong>5</strong> Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?  <strong>6</strong> But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.  <strong>7</strong> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.  <strong>8</strong> For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.  <strong>9</strong> And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:  <strong>10</strong> And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.  <strong>11</strong> And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?  <strong>12</strong> How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.  <strong>13</strong> Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.  <strong>14</strong> Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.  <strong>15</strong> But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  <strong>16</strong> And charged them that they should not make him known:  <strong>17</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  <strong>18</strong> Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.  <strong>19</strong> He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.  <strong>20</strong> A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.  <strong>21</strong> And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.  <strong>22</strong> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.  <strong>23</strong> And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?  <strong>24</strong> But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow  doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.  <strong>25</strong> And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:  <strong>26</strong> And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?  <strong>27</strong> And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.  <strong>28</strong> But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.  <strong>29</strong> Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.  <strong>30</strong> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. <strong>31</strong>           Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy  Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.  <strong>32</strong> And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.  <strong>33</strong> Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. <strong>34</strong> O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  <strong>35</strong> A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.  <strong>36</strong> But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.  <strong>37</strong> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. <strong>38</strong> Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.  <strong>39</strong> But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:  <strong>40</strong> For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  <strong>41</strong> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.  <strong>42</strong> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  <strong>43</strong> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  <strong>44</strong> Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.  <strong>45</strong> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. <strong>46</strong> While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  <strong>47</strong> Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  <strong>48</strong> But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?  <strong>49</strong> And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!  <strong>50</strong> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. <strong>1</strong> The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.  <strong>2</strong> And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.  <strong>3</strong> And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;  <strong>4</strong> And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:  <strong>5</strong> Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:  <strong>6</strong> And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.  <strong>7</strong> And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:  <strong>8</strong> But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.  <strong>9</strong> Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>10</strong> And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?  <strong>11</strong> He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.  <strong>12</strong> For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.  <strong>14</strong> And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:  <strong>15</strong> For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their  heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.  <strong>16</strong> But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.  <strong>17</strong> For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.  <strong>18</strong>           Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.  <strong>19</strong> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.  <strong>20</strong> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  <strong>21</strong> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.  <strong>22</strong> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  <strong>23</strong> But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. <strong>24</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:  <strong>25</strong> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.  <strong>26</strong> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.  <strong>27</strong> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  <strong>28</strong> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  <strong>29</strong> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.  <strong>30</strong> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. <strong>31</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:  <strong>32</strong> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <strong>33</strong> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  <strong>34</strong> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  <strong>35</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  <strong>36</strong> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;  <strong>38</strong> The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;  <strong>39</strong> The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  <strong>40</strong> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.  <strong>41</strong> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;  <strong>42</strong> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>43</strong> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <strong>44</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. <strong>45</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:  <strong>46</strong> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. <strong>47</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:  <strong>48</strong> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.  <strong>49</strong> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  <strong>50</strong> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>51</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?  They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  <strong>52</strong> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is  instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. <strong>53</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.  <strong>54</strong> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  <strong>55</strong> Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  <strong>56</strong> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?  <strong>57</strong> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.  <strong>58</strong> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.  <strong>1</strong> At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,  <strong>2</strong> And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  <strong>3</strong> For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him  in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.  <strong>4</strong> For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.  <strong>5</strong> And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.  <strong>6</strong> But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.  <strong>7</strong> Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask.  <strong>8</strong> And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist’s head in a charger.  <strong>9</strong> And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.  <strong>10</strong> And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.  <strong>11</strong> And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.  <strong>12</strong> And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and went and told Jesus.  <strong>13</strong> When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities.  <strong>14</strong> And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.  <strong>15</strong> And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.  <strong>16</strong> But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.  <strong>17</strong> And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.  <strong>18</strong> He said, Bring them hither to me.  <strong>19</strong> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  <strong>20</strong> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.  <strong>21</strong> And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.  <strong>22</strong> And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.  <strong>23</strong> And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.  <strong>24</strong> But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.  <strong>25</strong> And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.  <strong>26</strong> And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.  <strong>27</strong> But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.  <strong>28</strong> And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  <strong>29</strong> And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.  <strong>30</strong> But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.  <strong>31</strong> And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  <strong>32</strong> And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.  <strong>33</strong> Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.  <strong>34</strong> And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.  <strong>35</strong> And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;  <strong>36</strong> And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.  <strong>1</strong> Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.  <strong>3</strong> But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?  <strong>4</strong> For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.  <strong>5</strong> But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;  <strong>6</strong> And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.  Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.  <strong>7</strong> Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,  <strong>8</strong> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.  <strong>9</strong> But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <strong>10</strong> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:  <strong>11</strong> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.  <strong>12</strong> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?  <strong>13</strong> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.  <strong>14</strong> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  <strong>15</strong> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  <strong>16</strong> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  <strong>17</strong> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  <strong>18</strong> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  <strong>19</strong> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:  <strong>20</strong> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. <strong>21</strong> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  <strong>23</strong> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  <strong>24</strong> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  <strong>25</strong> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.  <strong>26</strong> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.  <strong>27</strong> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.  <strong>28</strong> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is  thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.  <strong>30</strong> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:  <strong>31</strong> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.  <strong>33</strong> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  <strong>34</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.  <strong>35</strong> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.  <strong>36</strong> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  <strong>37</strong> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.  <strong>38</strong> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.  <strong>39</strong> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,  <strong>1</strong> The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.  <strong>2</strong> He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.  <strong>3</strong> And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowring. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  <strong>4</strong> A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.  <strong>5</strong> And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.  <strong>6</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  <strong>7</strong> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.  <strong>8</strong> Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?  <strong>9</strong> Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  <strong>10</strong> Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  <strong>11</strong> How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  <strong>12</strong> Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.  <strong>13</strong> When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?  <strong>14</strong> And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.  <strong>15</strong> He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?  <strong>16</strong> And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>18</strong> And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  <strong>19</strong> And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ.  <strong>21</strong> From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day.  <strong>22</strong> Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.  <strong>23</strong> But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. <strong>24</strong> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  <strong>25</strong> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.  <strong>26</strong> For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  <strong>27</strong> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.  <strong>28</strong> Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. <strong>1</strong> And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,  <strong>2</strong> And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.  <strong>3</strong> And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.  <strong>4</strong> Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.  <strong>5</strong> While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.  <strong>6</strong> And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.  <strong>7</strong> And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.  <strong>8</strong> And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only.  <strong>9</strong> And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.  <strong>10</strong> And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.  <strong>12</strong> But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.  <strong>13</strong> Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.  <strong>14</strong> And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,  <strong>15</strong> Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.  <strong>16</strong> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.  <strong>17</strong> Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.  <strong>18</strong> And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.  <strong>19</strong> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?  <strong>20</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.  <strong>21</strong> Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.  <strong>22</strong> And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:  <strong>23</strong> And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.  <strong>24</strong> And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?  <strong>25</strong> He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?  <strong>26</strong> Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.  <strong>27</strong> Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee. <strong>1</strong> At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  <strong>2</strong> And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  <strong>3</strong> And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>4</strong> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>5</strong> And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.  <strong>6</strong> But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. <strong>7</strong>           Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  <strong>8</strong> Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.  <strong>9</strong> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and he began to teach them saying: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Joshua said to all the people, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Long ago your forefathers, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the River and worshiped other gods. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the River and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and I brought you out. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When I brought your fathers out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But they cried to the LORD for help, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians; he brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the desert for a long time. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"'Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you-also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Now fear the LORD and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your forefathers worshiped beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the people answered, \"Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> It was the LORD our God himself who brought us and our fathers up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, because he is our God.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Joshua said to the people, \"You are not able to serve the LORD. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But the people said to Joshua, \"No! We will serve the LORD.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Joshua said, \"You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD.Yes, we are witnesses,\" they replied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Now then,\" said Joshua, \"throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And the people said to Joshua, \"We will serve the LORD our God and obey him.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he drew up for them decrees and laws. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"See!\" he said to all the people. \"This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the LORD had done for Israel. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And Joseph's bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph's descendants. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
