She is worth far more than rubies. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
