Get them out of here, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, \"Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!\" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, \"Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Lot said to them, \"No, my lords, please! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it-it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to him, \"Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.\" (That is why the town was called Zoar. ) <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from the LORD out of the heavens. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities-and also the vegetation in the land. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him.

Amen.  <strong>26</strong> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  <strong>27</strong> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  <strong>28</strong> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  <strong>29</strong> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  <strong>30</strong> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  <strong>31</strong> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  <strong>32</strong> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

Amen. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity.

They are gossips, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

And David said, There is none like that; give it me.  <strong>10</strong> And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.  <strong>11</strong> And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?  <strong>12</strong> And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.  <strong>13</strong> And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.  <strong>14</strong> Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?  <strong>15</strong> Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow  to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?  <strong>1</strong> David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him.  <strong>2</strong> And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.  <strong>3</strong> And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be  with you, till I know what God will do for me.  <strong>4</strong> And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.  <strong>5</strong> And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah.

And he answered, Here I am, my lord.  <strong>13</strong> And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?  <strong>14</strong> Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so  faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king’s son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?  <strong>15</strong> Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.  <strong>16</strong> And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.  <strong>17</strong> And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.  <strong>19</strong> And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.  <strong>20</strong> And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.  <strong>21</strong> And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD’S priests.  <strong>22</strong> And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father’s house.  <strong>23</strong> Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her father's house in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her father's house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> His father-in-law, the girl's father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, \"Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girl's father said, \"Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl's father said, \"Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!\" So the two of them ate together. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said, \"Now look, it's almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, \"Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> His master replied, \"No. We won't go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He added, \"Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, \"Where are you going? Where did you come from?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He answered, \"We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants-me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You are welcome at my house,\" the old man said. \"Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, \"Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The owner of the house went outside and said to them, \"No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Get up; let's go.\" But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Everyone who saw it said, \"Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt.
