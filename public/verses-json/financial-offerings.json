I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. <strong>19</strong> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.  <strong>20</strong> And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?  <strong>21</strong> Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?  <strong>22</strong> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.  <strong>23</strong> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.  <strong>24</strong> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.  <strong>25</strong> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.  <strong>26</strong> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.  <strong>27</strong> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:  <strong>28</strong> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  <strong>29</strong> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.  <strong>30</strong> I and my Father are one.  <strong>31</strong> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.  <strong>32</strong> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?  <strong>33</strong> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?  <strong>35</strong> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;  <strong>36</strong> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?  <strong>37</strong> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.  <strong>38</strong> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.  <strong>39</strong> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,  <strong>40</strong> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.  <strong>41</strong> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.  <strong>42</strong> And many believed on him there.

He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Therefore Jesus said again, \"I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away.

I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life--only to take it up again. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> At these words the Jews were again divided. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Many of them said, \"He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But others said, \"These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Colonnade. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The Jews gathered around him, saying, \"How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> I and the Father are one.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> but Jesus said to them, \"I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"We are not stoning you for any of these,\" replied the Jews, \"but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken-- <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> and many people came to him. They said, \"Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And in that place many believed in Jesus.
