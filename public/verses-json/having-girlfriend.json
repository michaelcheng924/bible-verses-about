In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?

This is my rule in all the churches. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>Were you a bondservant when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a bondservant of Christ. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>You were bought with a price; do not become bondservants of men. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p46007024_14-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007031_14-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007035_14-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry—it is no sin. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007038_14-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives.

By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

And so he condemned sin in sinful man, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you.

But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?
