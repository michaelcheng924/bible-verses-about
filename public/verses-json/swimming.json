It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.

He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High.

And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.  <strong>4</strong> And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.  <strong>5</strong> And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.  <strong>6</strong> And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.  <strong>7</strong> And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;  <strong>8</strong> And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.  <strong>9</strong> Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,  <strong>10</strong> And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.  <strong>11</strong> Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.  <strong>12</strong> And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.  <strong>13</strong> And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.  <strong>14</strong> But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.  <strong>15</strong> And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.  <strong>16</strong> And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:  <strong>17</strong> Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.  <strong>18</strong> And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day  they lightened the ship;  <strong>19</strong> And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.  <strong>20</strong> And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.  <strong>21</strong> But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.  <strong>22</strong> And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.  <strong>23</strong> For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,  <strong>24</strong> Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.  <strong>25</strong> Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.  <strong>26</strong> Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.  <strong>27</strong> But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;  <strong>28</strong> And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.  <strong>29</strong> Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.  <strong>30</strong> And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,  <strong>31</strong> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.  <strong>32</strong> Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.  <strong>33</strong> And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.  <strong>34</strong> Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.  <strong>35</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.  <strong>36</strong> Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some  meat.  <strong>37</strong> And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.  <strong>38</strong> And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.  <strong>39</strong> And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.  <strong>40</strong> And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves  unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.  <strong>41</strong> And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.  <strong>42</strong> And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.  <strong>43</strong> But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their  purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:  <strong>44</strong> And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. So Paul warned them, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the \"northeaster,\" swept down from the island. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: \"Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.' <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, \"Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. \"For the last fourteen days,\" he said, \"you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven't eaten anything. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Altogether there were 276 of us on board. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety.

my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?  <strong>3</strong> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.  <strong>4</strong> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:  <strong>5</strong> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  <strong>6</strong> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.  <strong>7</strong> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  <strong>8</strong> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.  <strong>9</strong> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.  <strong>10</strong> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.  <strong>11</strong> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.  <strong>12</strong> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.  <strong>13</strong> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.  <strong>14</strong> She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.  <strong>15</strong> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.  <strong>16</strong> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.  <strong>17</strong> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.  <strong>18</strong> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.  <strong>19</strong> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.  <strong>20</strong> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.  <strong>21</strong> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.  <strong>22</strong> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is  silk and purple.  <strong>23</strong> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.  <strong>24</strong> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  <strong>25</strong> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.  <strong>26</strong> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.  <strong>27</strong> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.  <strong>28</strong> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,  and he praiseth her.  <strong>29</strong> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.  <strong>30</strong> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but  a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.  <strong>31</strong> Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The sayings of King Lemuel-an oracle his mother taught him: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> do not spend your strength on women, your vigor on those who ruin kings. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"It is not for kings, O Lemuel- not for kings to drink wine, not for rulers to crave beer, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> lest they drink and forget what the law decrees, and deprive all the oppressed of their rights. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Give beer to those who are perishing, wine to those who are in anguish; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.\" Epilogue: The Wife of Noble Character <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
