It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you.

But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.  <strong>28</strong> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  <strong>29</strong> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  <strong>30</strong> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  <strong>31</strong> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.  <strong>32</strong> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  <strong>33</strong> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.  <strong>34</strong> Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.  <strong>35</strong> But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?  <strong>36</strong> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:  <strong>37</strong> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:  <strong>38</strong> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.  <strong>39</strong> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.  <strong>40</strong> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  <strong>41</strong> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.  <strong>42</strong> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  <strong>43</strong> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:  <strong>44</strong> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  <strong>45</strong> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  <strong>46</strong> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  <strong>47</strong> The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.  <strong>48</strong> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  <strong>49</strong> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  <strong>50</strong> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  <strong>52</strong> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  <strong>53</strong> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  <strong>54</strong> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  <strong>55</strong> O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is  thy victory?  <strong>56</strong> The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is  the law.  <strong>57</strong> But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong>58</strong> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  <strong>1</strong> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.  <strong>2</strong> Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.  <strong>3</strong> And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.  <strong>4</strong> And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.  <strong>5</strong> Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.  <strong>6</strong> And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.  <strong>7</strong> For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.  <strong>8</strong> But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.  <strong>9</strong> For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are  many adversaries.  <strong>10</strong> Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.  <strong>11</strong> Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.  <strong>12</strong> As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.  <strong>13</strong> Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.  <strong>14</strong> Let all your things be done with charity.  <strong>15</strong> I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)  <strong>16</strong> That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.  <strong>17</strong> I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.  <strong>18</strong> For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.  <strong>19</strong> The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.  <strong>20</strong> All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.  <strong>21</strong> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.  <strong>22</strong> If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.

They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"'Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"'For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says to them: See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge between one sheep and another. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the LORD have spoken. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"'I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the desert and sleep in the forests in safety. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will bless them and the places surrounding my hill. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The trees of the field will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are people, and I am your God, declares the Sovereign LORD.'\"
