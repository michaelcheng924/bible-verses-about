O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is  good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>2</strong> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?  <strong>3</strong> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.  <strong>4</strong> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto  thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;  <strong>5</strong> That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.  <strong>6</strong> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.  <strong>7</strong> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even  at the Red sea.  <strong>8</strong> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.  <strong>9</strong> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.  <strong>10</strong> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.  <strong>11</strong> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.  <strong>12</strong> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.  <strong>13</strong> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:  <strong>14</strong> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.  <strong>15</strong> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.  <strong>16</strong> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.  <strong>18</strong> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.  <strong>19</strong> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.  <strong>20</strong> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.  <strong>21</strong> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;  <strong>22</strong> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. <strong>24</strong> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:  <strong>25</strong> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.  <strong>26</strong> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:  <strong>27</strong> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.  <strong>28</strong> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.  <strong>29</strong> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.  <strong>30</strong> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.  <strong>31</strong> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.  <strong>32</strong> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:  <strong>33</strong> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.  <strong>34</strong> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:  <strong>35</strong> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.  <strong>36</strong> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.  <strong>37</strong> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,  <strong>38</strong> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.  <strong>39</strong> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.  <strong>40</strong> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.  <strong>41</strong> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.  <strong>42</strong> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.  <strong>43</strong> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.  <strong>44</strong> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:  <strong>45</strong> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.  <strong>46</strong> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.  <strong>47</strong> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.  <strong>48</strong> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen.

Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So he said he would destroy them- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods; <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them; <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;

My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. \"For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; upon them he has set the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. \"It is not by strength that one prevails; <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. \"He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \"Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the man said to him, \"Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want,\" the servant would then answer, \"No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they were treating the LORD's offering with contempt. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Samuel was ministering before the LORD -a boy wearing a linen ephod. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, \"May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD.\" Then they would go home. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So he said to them, \"Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?\" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, \"This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you-they will both die on the same day. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, \"Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.\"'\" "},{"_id":"6168fd22803fbb813a70ad25","topicId":"6168fd1f803fbb813a70ad1c","verse":"1 Samuel 1:1-28","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p09001001_05-12\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v09001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09001002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>He had two wives.

It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you.

Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  <strong>18</strong> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  <strong>19</strong> For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.  <strong>20</strong> For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,  ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.  <strong>21</strong> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:  <strong>22</strong> Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:  <strong>23</strong> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:  <strong>24</strong> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.  <strong>25</strong> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

But to those who do not believe, \"The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, \" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and, \"A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.\" They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
