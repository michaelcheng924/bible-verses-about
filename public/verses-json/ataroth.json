(Arba was the forefather of Anak.) <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But the fields and villages around the city they had given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Libnah, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jattir, Eshtemoa, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Holon, Debir, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh, together with their pasturelands-nine towns from these two tribes. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Anathoth and Almon, together with their pasturelands-four towns. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> All the towns for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were thirteen, together with their pasturelands. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The rest of the Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted towns from the tribe of Ephraim: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In the hill country of Ephraim they were given Shechem (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Gezer, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Kibzaim and Beth Horon, together with their pasturelands-four towns. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Also from the tribe of Dan they received Eltekeh, Gibbethon, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Aijalon and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands-four towns. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> From half the tribe of Manasseh they received Taanach and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands-two towns. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> All these ten towns and their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The Levite clans of the Gershonites were given: from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Be Eshtarah, together with their pasturelands-two towns; <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion, Daberath, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jarmuth and En Gannim, together with their pasturelands-four towns; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> from the tribe of Asher, Mishal, Abdon, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Helkath and Rehob, together with their pasturelands-four towns; <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Hammoth Dor and Kartan, together with their pasturelands-three towns. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> All the towns of the Gershonite clans were thirteen, together with their pasturelands. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The Merarite clans (the rest of the Levites) were given: from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam, Kartah, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Dimnah and Nahalal, together with their pasturelands-four towns; <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer, Jahaz, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Kedemoth and Mephaath, together with their pasturelands-four towns; <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Mahanaim, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Heshbon and Jazer, together with their pasturelands-four towns in all. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> All the towns allotted to the Merarite clans, who were the rest of the Levites, were twelve. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The towns of the Levites in the territory held by the Israelites were forty-eight in all, together with their pasturelands. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it; this was true for all these towns. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> So the LORD gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their forefathers, and they took possession of it and settled there. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The LORD gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their forefathers.

(Arba was the forefather of Anak.) <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites-Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai-descendants of Anak. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher). <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And Caleb said, \"I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, \"What can I do for you?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> She replied, \"Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.\" So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> This is the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, clan by clan: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The southernmost towns of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the boundary of Edom were: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (that is, Hazor), <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Amam, Shema, Moladah, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Baalah, Iim, Ezem, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain and Rimmon-a total of twenty-nine towns and their villages. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In the western foothills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Shaaraim, Adithaim and Gederah (or Gederothaim) -fourteen towns and their villages. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal Gad, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Cabbon, Lahmas, Kitlish, <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Gederoth, Beth Dagon, Naamah and Makkedah-sixteen towns and their villages. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Libnah, Ether, Ashan, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Keilah, Aczib and Mareshah-nine towns and their villages. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Ekron, with its surrounding settlements and villages; <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> west of Ekron, all that were in the vicinity of Ashdod, together with their villages; <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Ashdod, its surrounding settlements and villages; and Gaza, its settlements and villages, as far as the Wadi of Egypt and the coastline of the Great Sea. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> In the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (that is, Debir), <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Goshen, Holon and Giloh-eleven towns and their villages. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Arab, Dumah, Eshan, <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah, <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Humtah, Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) and Zior-nine towns and their villages. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Kain, Gibeah and Timnah-ten towns and their villages. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor, <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Maarath, Beth Anoth and Eltekon-six towns and their villages. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah-two towns and their villages. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> In the desert: Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah, <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Nibshan, the City of Salt and En Gedi-six towns and their villages. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Judah could not dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the people of Judah.
