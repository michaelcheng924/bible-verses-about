I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.  <strong>20</strong> The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.  <strong>21</strong> This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.  <strong>22</strong> But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.  <strong>23</strong> Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.  <strong>24</strong> Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.  <strong>25</strong> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.  <strong>26</strong> Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.  <strong>27</strong> Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.  <strong>28</strong> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For I am the LORD, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your stead. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you, and people in exchange for your life. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.'
