And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.  <strong>15</strong> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,  <strong>16</strong> And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?  <strong>18</strong> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.  <strong>19</strong> And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. <strong>20</strong> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:  <strong>21</strong> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.  <strong>22</strong> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not seeit.  <strong>23</strong> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.  <strong>24</strong> For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part  under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.  <strong>25</strong> But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.  <strong>26</strong> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.  <strong>27</strong> They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.  <strong>28</strong> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  <strong>29</strong> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.  <strong>30</strong> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.  <strong>31</strong> In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.  <strong>32</strong> Remember Lot’s wife.  <strong>33</strong> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.  <strong>34</strong> I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.  <strong>35</strong> Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>36</strong> Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>37</strong> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus said to his disciples: \"Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So watch yourselves. \"If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith!\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He replied, \"If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Would he not rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and called out in a loud voice, \"Jesus, Master, have pity on us!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When he saw them, he said, \"Go, show yourselves to the priests.\" And as they went, they were cleansed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus asked, \"Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then he said to him, \"Rise and go; your faith has made you well.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, \"The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then he said to his disciples, \"The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Men will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Remember Lot's wife! <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"Where, Lord?\" they asked.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, \"Cornelius!\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Cornelius stared at him in fear. \"What is it, Lord?\" he asked. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then a voice told him, \"Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Surely not, Lord!\" Peter replied. \"I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The voice spoke to him a second time, \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, \"Simon, three men are looking for you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Peter went down and said to the men, \"I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men replied, \"We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Peter made him get up. \"Stand up,\" he said, \"I am only a man myself.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to them: \"You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cornelius answered: \"Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  <strong>2</strong> And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  <strong>3</strong> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  <strong>4</strong> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  <strong>5</strong> But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  <strong>6</strong> He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  <strong>7</strong> Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  <strong>16</strong> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  <strong>17</strong> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  <strong>18</strong> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  <strong>19</strong> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  <strong>20</strong> But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  <strong>21</strong> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  <strong>22</strong> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.  <strong>23</strong> Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  <strong>24</strong> Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.  <strong>25</strong> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.  <strong>26</strong> These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.  <strong>27</strong> But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  <strong>28</strong> And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.  <strong>29</strong> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"6168f710803fbb813a70aa2c","topicId":"6168f70b803fbb813a70aa1c","verse":"Acts 2:17","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p44002017_01-17\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v44002017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;“‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares,</span><br><span id=\"p44002017_01-17\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,</span><br><span id=\"p44002017_01-17\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,</span><br><span id=\"p44002017_01-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your young men shall see visions,</span><br><span id=\"p44002017_01-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your old men shall dream dreams;</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  ","niv":"<sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people.

 <strong>2</strong> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.  <strong>3</strong> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <strong>4</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <strong>6</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <strong>7</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.  <strong>8</strong> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.  <strong>10</strong> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.  <strong>11</strong> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:  <strong>12</strong> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.  <strong>13</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art  thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.  <strong>14</strong> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?  <strong>15</strong> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and  fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.  <strong>16</strong> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.  <strong>17</strong> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  <strong>18</strong> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of  the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  <strong>19</strong> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <strong>20</strong> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <strong>21</strong> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.  <strong>22</strong> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  <strong>23</strong> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.  <strong>24</strong> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  <strong>25</strong> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  <strong>26</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <strong>27</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Where have you come from?\" David asked him. He answered, \"I have escaped from the Israelite camp.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"What happened?\" David asked. \"Tell me.\" He said, \"The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, \"How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,\" the young man said, \"and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, 'What can I do?' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"He asked me, 'Who are you?'\"'An Amalekite,' I answered. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then he said to me, 'Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> David said to the young man who brought him the report, \"Where are you from?I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite,\" he answered. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David asked him, \"Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then David called one of his men and said, \"Go, strike him down!\" So he struck him down, and he died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For David had said to him, \"Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen!
