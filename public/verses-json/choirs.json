Abraham his servant.  <strong>43</strong> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:  <strong>44</strong> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;  <strong>45</strong> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
