Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,  <strong>3</strong> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  <strong>4</strong> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of  Baal.  <strong>5</strong> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <strong>6</strong> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.  <strong>7</strong> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded  <strong>8</strong> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  <strong>10</strong> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  <strong>11</strong> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  <strong>12</strong> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?  <strong>13</strong> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  <strong>14</strong> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them.  <strong>15</strong> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  <strong>16</strong> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  <strong>17</strong> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  <strong>18</strong> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.  <strong>20</strong> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  <strong>21</strong> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.  <strong>22</strong> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  <strong>23</strong> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  <strong>24</strong> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?  <strong>25</strong> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  <strong>26</strong> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  <strong>27</strong> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  <strong>28</strong> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers‚Äô sakes.  <strong>29</strong> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.  <strong>30</strong> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  <strong>31</strong> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  <strong>32</strong> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  <strong>33</strong> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  <strong>34</strong> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  <strong>35</strong> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  <strong>36</strong> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.

I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me\"? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And what was God's answer to him? \"I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did.

Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You will say then, \"Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \"The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things.
