Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: \"Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> to those who say, \"Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come, so we may know it.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily! <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal thong is broken. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds.

he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.  <strong>40</strong> And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.  <strong>41</strong> And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be  an abomination; it shall not be eaten.  <strong>42</strong> Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all  four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.  <strong>43</strong> Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.  <strong>44</strong> For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  <strong>45</strong> For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.  <strong>46</strong> This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:  <strong>47</strong> To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Say to the Israelites: 'Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"'There are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The coney, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams, you may eat any that have fins and scales. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales-whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water-you are to detest. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"'These are the birds you are to detest and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> the red kite, any kind of black kite, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> any kind of raven, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> There are, however, some winged creatures that walk on all fours that you may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But all other winged creatures that have four legs you are to detest. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"'You will make yourselves unclean by these; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'Every animal that has a split hoof not completely divided or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them will be unclean. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Of all the animals that walk on all fours, those that walk on their paws are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. They are unclean for you. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"'Of the animals that move about on the ground, these are unclean for you: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink and the chameleon. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Of all those that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth. Put it in water; it will be unclean till evening, and then it will be clean. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean, and you must break the pot. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Any food that could be eaten but has water on it from such a pot is unclean, and any liquid that could be drunk from it is unclean. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean, and you are to regard them as unclean. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> A spring, however, or a cistern for collecting water remains clean, but anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> If a carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted, they remain clean. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"'If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches the carcass will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Anyone who eats some of the carcass must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"'Every creature that moves about on the ground is detestable; it is not to be eaten. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> You are not to eat any creature that moves about on the ground, whether it moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet; it is detestable. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves unclean by means of them or be made unclean by them. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves about on the ground. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> I am the LORD who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"'These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing that moves in the water and every creature that moves about on the ground. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.'\" "}]}
