And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>9</strong> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.  <strong>11</strong> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.  <strong>12</strong> Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.  <strong>13</strong> They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.  <strong>14</strong> And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.  <strong>15</strong> But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. <strong>16</strong>           No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.  <strong>17</strong> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.  <strong>18</strong> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. <strong>19</strong> Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.  <strong>20</strong> And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.  <strong>21</strong> And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. <strong>22</strong> Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.  <strong>23</strong> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.  <strong>24</strong> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.  <strong>25</strong> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.  <strong>26</strong> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.  <strong>27</strong> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.  <strong>28</strong> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.  <strong>29</strong> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.  <strong>31</strong> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.  <strong>32</strong> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.  <strong>33</strong> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.  <strong>34</strong> When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.  <strong>35</strong> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  <strong>36</strong> They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.  <strong>37</strong> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.  <strong>38</strong> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,  <strong>39</strong> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.  <strong>40</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.  <strong>41</strong> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:  <strong>42</strong> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.  <strong>43</strong> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,  <strong>44</strong> Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.  <strong>45</strong> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  <strong>46</strong> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.  <strong>47</strong> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. <strong>49</strong> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.  <strong>50</strong> But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.  <strong>51</strong> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.  <strong>52</strong> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.  <strong>53</strong> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.  <strong>54</strong> And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.  <strong>55</strong> And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.  <strong>56</strong> And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.\" When he said this, he called out, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> His disciples asked him what this parable meant. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He said, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, \"'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He replied, \"My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> One day Jesus said to his disciples, \"Let's go over to the other side of the lake.\" So they got into a boat and set out. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we're going to drown!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. \"Where is your faith?\" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, \"Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Legion,\" he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Return home and tell how much God has done for you.\" So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" he said. \"Don't bother the teacher any more.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \"Stop wailing,\" Jesus said. \"She is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> But he took her by the hand and said, \"My child, get up!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
