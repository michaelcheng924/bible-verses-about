judgment, and equity;  <strong>4</strong> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.  <strong>5</strong> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:  <strong>6</strong> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.  <strong>7</strong> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but  fools despise wisdom and instruction.  <strong>8</strong> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:  <strong>9</strong> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.  <strong>10</strong> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.  <strong>11</strong> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:  <strong>12</strong> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:  <strong>13</strong> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:  <strong>14</strong> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:  <strong>15</strong> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:  <strong>16</strong> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.  <strong>17</strong> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.  <strong>18</strong> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.  <strong>19</strong> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.  <strong>20</strong> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:  <strong>21</strong> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,  <strong>22</strong> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?  <strong>23</strong> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.  <strong>24</strong> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;  <strong>25</strong> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:  <strong>26</strong> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;  <strong>27</strong> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.  <strong>28</strong> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:  <strong>29</strong> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:  <strong>30</strong> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.  <strong>31</strong> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.  <strong>32</strong> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.  <strong>33</strong> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall
