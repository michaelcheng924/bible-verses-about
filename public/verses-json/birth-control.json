sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.  <strong>7</strong> And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.  <strong>8</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.  <strong>9</strong> For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.  <strong>11</strong> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.  <strong>12</strong> Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray

whence I caused you to be carried away captive.  <strong>15</strong> Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;  <strong>16</strong> Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;  <strong>17</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.  <strong>18</strong> And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:  <strong>19</strong> Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.  <strong>20</strong> Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:  <strong>21</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;  <strong>22</strong> And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;  <strong>23</strong> Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.  <strong>24</strong>           Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,  <strong>25</strong> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  <strong>26</strong> The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is  mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.  <strong>27</strong> Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?  <strong>28</strong> For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them;  and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  <strong>29</strong> And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.  <strong>30</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>31</strong> Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:  <strong>32</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.  <strong>3</strong> For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.  <strong>4</strong> And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.  <strong>5</strong> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.  <strong>6</strong> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?  <strong>7</strong> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.  <strong>8</strong> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:  <strong>9</strong> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.  <strong>11</strong> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.  <strong>12</strong> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and  thy wound is grievous.  <strong>13</strong> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.  <strong>14</strong> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.  <strong>15</strong> Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.  <strong>17</strong> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.  <strong>18</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.  <strong>19</strong> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.  <strong>20</strong> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.  <strong>21</strong> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  <strong>23</strong> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.  <strong>24</strong> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.  <strong>1</strong> At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.  <strong>3</strong> The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.  <strong>4</strong> Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.  <strong>5</strong> Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.  <strong>6</strong> For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God.  <strong>7</strong> For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.  <strong>8</strong> Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that

the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.  <strong>32</strong> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.  <strong>1</strong> A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.  <strong>2</strong> When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.  <strong>3</strong> The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.  <strong>4</strong> Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.  <strong>5</strong> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.  <strong>6</strong> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.  <strong>7</strong> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.  <strong>8</strong> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.  <strong>9</strong> An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.  <strong>10</strong> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.  <strong>11</strong> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.  <strong>12</strong> He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.  <strong>13</strong> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.  <strong>14</strong> Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.  <strong>15</strong> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.  <strong>16</strong> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.  <strong>17</strong> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is  cruel troubleth his own flesh.  <strong>18</strong> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.  <strong>19</strong> As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.  <strong>20</strong> They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.  <strong>21</strong> Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.  <strong>22</strong> As a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.  <strong>23</strong> The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.

And there was a sore famine in Samaria.  <strong>3</strong> And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his  house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:  <strong>4</strong> For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  <strong>5</strong> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.  <strong>6</strong> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  <strong>7</strong> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  <strong>8</strong> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>9</strong> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  <strong>10</strong> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is  not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  <strong>11</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>12</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  <strong>13</strong> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <strong>14</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here:  and he shall slay me.  <strong>15</strong> And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.  <strong>16</strong> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.  <strong>20</strong> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.  <strong>21</strong> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.  <strong>23</strong> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it  on wood, and put no fire under:  <strong>24</strong> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.  <strong>25</strong> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.  <strong>26</strong> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.  <strong>28</strong> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  <strong>30</strong> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.  <strong>31</strong> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:  <strong>32</strong> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.  <strong>33</strong> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it  the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  <strong>35</strong> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that  I have done all these things at thy word.  <strong>37</strong> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.  <strong>38</strong> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.  <strong>39</strong> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.  <strong>40</strong> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.  <strong>41</strong> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.  <strong>42</strong> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,  <strong>43</strong> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.  <strong>44</strong> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.  <strong>45</strong> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.  <strong>46</strong> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.  <strong>1</strong> And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.  <strong>2</strong> Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.  <strong>3</strong> And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer-sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.  <strong>4</strong> But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.  <strong>5</strong> And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.  <strong>6</strong> And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.  <strong>7</strong> And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.  <strong>8</strong> And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.  <strong>9</strong> And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  <strong>11</strong> And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but  the LORD was not in the earthquake:  <strong>12</strong> And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was  not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.  <strong>13</strong> And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?  <strong>14</strong> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  <strong>15</strong> And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:  <strong>16</strong> And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.  <strong>18</strong> Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.  <strong>19</strong> So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.  <strong>20</strong> And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?  <strong>21</strong> And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat.

And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.  <strong>21</strong> But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.  <strong>23</strong> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.  <strong>24</strong> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.  <strong>25</strong> And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, so the LORD delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was sterile and remained childless. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD appeared to her and said, \"You are sterile and childless, but you are going to conceive and have a son. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> because you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor may be used on his head, because the boy is to be a Nazirite, set apart to God from birth, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the woman went to her husband and told him, \"A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn't ask him where he came from, and he didn't tell me his name. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But he said to me, 'You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Manoah prayed to the LORD: \"O LORD, I beg you, let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The woman hurried to tell her husband, \"He's here! The man who appeared to me the other day!\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, \"Are you the one who talked to my wife?I am,\" he said. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Manoah asked him, \"When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule for the boy's life and work?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD answered, \"Your wife must do all that I have told her. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, \"We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD replied, \"Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.\" (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the LORD.) <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the LORD, \"What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He replied, \"Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding. \" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the LORD. And the LORD did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched: <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the angel of the LORD did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"We are doomed to die!\" he said to his wife. \"We have seen God!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But his wife answered, \"If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the LORD blessed him, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> and the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
