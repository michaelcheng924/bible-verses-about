But you--who are you to judge your neighbor? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now listen, you who say, \"Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Instead, you ought to say, \"If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As it is, you boast and brag. All such boasting is evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins.

Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v59004002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v59004003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v59004004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v59004005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v59004006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v59004007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v59004008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.
