But each one should be careful how he builds. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light.
