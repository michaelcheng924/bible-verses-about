Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the Pharisees said to one another, \"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed.

Who is this 'Son of Man'?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\" When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: \"Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then Jesus cried out, \"When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I know that his command leads to eternal life.

Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)  <strong>6</strong> God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?  <strong>7</strong> For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?  <strong>8</strong> And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.  <strong>9</strong> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;  <strong>10</strong> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  <strong>11</strong> There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.  <strong>12</strong> They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.  <strong>13</strong> Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:  <strong>14</strong> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:  <strong>15</strong> Their feet are swift to shed blood:  <strong>16</strong> Destruction and misery are in their ways:  <strong>17</strong> And the way of peace have they not known:  <strong>18</strong> There is no fear of God before their eyes.  <strong>19</strong> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.  <strong>20</strong> Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.  <strong>21</strong> But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;  <strong>22</strong> Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:  <strong>23</strong> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;  <strong>24</strong> Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:  <strong>25</strong> Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;  <strong>26</strong> To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.  <strong>27</strong> Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.  <strong>28</strong> Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.  <strong>29</strong> Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:  <strong>30</strong> Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.  <strong>31</strong> Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.  <strong>1</strong> What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?  <strong>2</strong> For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.  <strong>3</strong> For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.  <strong>4</strong> Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.  <strong>5</strong> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.  <strong>6</strong> Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,  <strong>7</strong> Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.  <strong>8</strong> Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  <strong>9</strong> Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only,  or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.  <strong>10</strong> How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.  <strong>11</strong> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:  <strong>12</strong> And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.  <strong>13</strong> For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was  not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.  <strong>14</strong> For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:  <strong>15</strong> Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is  no transgression.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,  <strong>17</strong> (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.  <strong>18</strong> Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.  <strong>19</strong> And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:  <strong>20</strong> He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;  <strong>21</strong> And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.  <strong>22</strong> And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.  <strong>23</strong> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;  <strong>24</strong> But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;  <strong>25</strong> Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.  <strong>1</strong> Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:  <strong>2</strong> By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.  <strong>3</strong> And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;  <strong>4</strong> And patience, experience; and experience, hope:  <strong>5</strong> And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.  <strong>6</strong> For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.  <strong>7</strong> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.  <strong>8</strong> But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.  <strong>9</strong> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.  <strong>10</strong> For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.  <strong>11</strong> And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:  <strong>13</strong> (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.  <strong>14</strong> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.  <strong>15</strong> But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.  <strong>16</strong> And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.  <strong>17</strong> For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)  <strong>18</strong> Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came  upon all men unto justification of life.  <strong>19</strong> For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.  <strong>20</strong> Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:  <strong>21</strong> That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>1</strong> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?  <strong>2</strong> God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?  <strong>3</strong> Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?  <strong>4</strong> Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  <strong>5</strong> For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:  <strong>6</strong> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  <strong>7</strong> For he that is dead is freed from sin.  <strong>8</strong> Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:  <strong>9</strong> Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.  <strong>10</strong> For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.  <strong>11</strong> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>12</strong> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.  <strong>13</strong> Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.  <strong>14</strong> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.  <strong>15</strong> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.  <strong>16</strong> Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?  <strong>17</strong> But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.  <strong>18</strong> Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.  <strong>19</strong> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.  <strong>20</strong> For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.  <strong>21</strong> What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.  <strong>22</strong> But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.  <strong>23</strong> For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is  eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  <strong>1</strong> Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?  <strong>2</strong> For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her  husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.  <strong>3</strong> So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.  <strong>4</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.  <strong>5</strong> For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.  <strong>6</strong> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.  <strong>7</strong> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  <strong>8</strong> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.  <strong>9</strong> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  <strong>10</strong> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.  <strong>11</strong> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  <strong>13</strong> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  <strong>14</strong> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  <strong>15</strong> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  <strong>16</strong> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.  <strong>17</strong> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <strong>18</strong> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  <strong>19</strong> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  <strong>20</strong> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <strong>21</strong> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  <strong>22</strong> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  <strong>23</strong> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  <strong>24</strong> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  <strong>25</strong> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.  <strong>1</strong>           There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  <strong>2</strong> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.  <strong>3</strong> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:  <strong>4</strong> That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  <strong>5</strong> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.  <strong>6</strong> For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.  <strong>7</strong> Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  <strong>8</strong> So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  <strong>9</strong> But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  <strong>10</strong> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  <strong>11</strong> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  <strong>13</strong> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  <strong>14</strong> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  <strong>15</strong> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  <strong>16</strong> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  <strong>17</strong> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  <strong>18</strong> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are  not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.  <strong>19</strong> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  <strong>20</strong> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  <strong>21</strong> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  <strong>22</strong> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  <strong>23</strong> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  <strong>24</strong> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  <strong>25</strong> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  <strong>26</strong> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  <strong>27</strong> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  <strong>28</strong> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  <strong>29</strong> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  <strong>30</strong> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  <strong>31</strong> What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?  <strong>32</strong> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  <strong>33</strong> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is  God that justifieth.  <strong>34</strong> Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  <strong>35</strong> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  <strong>36</strong> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  <strong>37</strong> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  <strong>38</strong> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  <strong>39</strong> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  <strong>1</strong> I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,  <strong>2</strong> That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.  <strong>3</strong> For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:  <strong>4</strong> Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;  <strong>5</strong> Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.  <strong>6</strong> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:  <strong>7</strong> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.  <strong>8</strong> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are  not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.  <strong>9</strong> For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.  <strong>10</strong> And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;  <strong>11</strong> (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)  <strong>12</strong> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.  <strong>13</strong> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.  <strong>14</strong> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.  <strong>15</strong> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  <strong>16</strong> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.  <strong>17</strong> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.  <strong>18</strong> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?  <strong>20</strong> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?  <strong>21</strong> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  <strong>22</strong> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:  <strong>23</strong> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,  <strong>24</strong> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?  <strong>25</strong> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.  <strong>26</strong> And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.  <strong>27</strong> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:  <strong>28</strong> For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.  <strong>30</strong> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.  <strong>31</strong> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  <strong>33</strong> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: \"So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.) <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Someone might argue, \"If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Why not say--as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say--\"Let us do evil that good may result\"? Their condemnation is deserved. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin.

And they murmured against her.  <strong>6</strong> And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.  <strong>7</strong> For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.  <strong>8</strong> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.  <strong>9</strong> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. <strong>10</strong> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.  <strong>11</strong> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.  <strong>12</strong> And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  <strong>13</strong> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.  <strong>14</strong> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  <strong>15</strong> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and  prepared: there make ready for us.  <strong>16</strong> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.  <strong>17</strong> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.  <strong>18</strong> And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.  <strong>19</strong> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?  <strong>20</strong> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.  <strong>21</strong> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. <strong>22</strong> And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.  <strong>23</strong> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it  to them: and they all drank of it.  <strong>24</strong> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.  <strong>25</strong> Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. <strong>26</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.  <strong>28</strong> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>29</strong> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will  not I.  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>31</strong> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.  <strong>32</strong> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.  <strong>33</strong> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;  <strong>34</strong> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.  <strong>35</strong> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.  <strong>36</strong> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.  <strong>37</strong> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  <strong>38</strong> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>39</strong> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.  <strong>40</strong> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.  <strong>41</strong> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>42</strong> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. <strong>43</strong> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.  <strong>44</strong> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.  <strong>45</strong> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.  <strong>46</strong> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.  <strong>47</strong> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  <strong>48</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?  <strong>49</strong> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.  <strong>50</strong> And they all forsook him, and fled.  <strong>51</strong> And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:  <strong>52</strong> And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.  <strong>53</strong> And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.  <strong>54</strong> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.  <strong>55</strong> And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.  <strong>56</strong> For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.  <strong>57</strong> And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,  <strong>58</strong> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.  <strong>59</strong> But neither so did their witness agree together.  <strong>60</strong> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>61</strong> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?  <strong>62</strong> And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>63</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?  <strong>64</strong> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.  <strong>65</strong> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.  <strong>66</strong> And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:  <strong>67</strong> And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>68</strong> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.  <strong>69</strong> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.  <strong>70</strong> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.  <strong>71</strong> But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.  <strong>72</strong> And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"But not during the Feast,\" they said, \"or the people may riot.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, \"Why this waste of perfume? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor.\" And they rebuked her harshly. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" said Jesus. \"Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, \"Surely not I?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"It is one of the Twelve,\" he replied, \"one who dips bread into the bowl with me. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take it; this is my body.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,\" he said to them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You will all fall away,\" Jesus told them, \"for it is written: \"'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Peter declared, \"Even if all fall away, I will not.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Peter insisted emphatically, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the others said the same. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,\" he said to them. \"Stay here and keep watch.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Abba, Father,\" he said, \"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Simon,\" he said to Peter, \"are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Returning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Then everyone deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> \"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. \"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.

And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.  <strong>16</strong> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.  <strong>17</strong> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?  <strong>18</strong> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.  <strong>19</strong> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.  <strong>20</strong> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  <strong>21</strong> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  <strong>22</strong> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  <strong>23</strong> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  <strong>24</strong> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.  <strong>25</strong> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. <strong>26</strong> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,  and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.  <strong>27</strong> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;  <strong>28</strong> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.  <strong>29</strong> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.  <strong>30</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>31</strong> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  <strong>32</strong> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>33</strong> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.  <strong>34</strong> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>35</strong> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.  <strong>36</strong> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.  <strong>37</strong> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.  <strong>38</strong> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.  <strong>39</strong> And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.  <strong>40</strong> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  <strong>41</strong> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>42</strong> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.  <strong>43</strong> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.  <strong>44</strong> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.  <strong>45</strong> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>46</strong> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.  <strong>47</strong> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  <strong>48</strong> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.  <strong>49</strong> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.  <strong>50</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  <strong>51</strong> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his  hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.  <strong>52</strong> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  <strong>53</strong> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  <strong>54</strong> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  <strong>55</strong> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.  <strong>56</strong> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.  <strong>57</strong> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.  <strong>58</strong> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  <strong>59</strong> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  <strong>60</strong> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet  found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,  <strong>61</strong> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.  <strong>62</strong> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>63</strong> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.  <strong>64</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>65</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.  <strong>66</strong> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.  <strong>67</strong> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,  <strong>68</strong> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?  <strong>69</strong> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.  <strong>70</strong> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.  <strong>71</strong> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>72</strong> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.  <strong>73</strong> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  <strong>74</strong> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.

I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And while they were eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, \"Surely not I, Lord?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, \"Surely not I, Rabbi?\" Jesus answered, \"Yes, it is you.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take and eat; this is my body.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, \"Drink from it, all of you. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus told them, \"This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: \"'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But Peter declared, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the other disciples said the same. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, \"Sit here while I go over there and pray.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then he said to them, \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, \"My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?\" he asked Peter. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He went away a second time and prayed, \"My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Greetings, Rabbi!\" and kissed him. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Friend, do what you came for.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"Put your sword back in its place,\" Jesus said to him, \"for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> At that time Jesus said to the crowd, \"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Finally two came forward and declared, \"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, \"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. \"But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, \"He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> What do you think?He is worthy of death,\" they answered. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> and said, \"Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?\" <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. \"You also were with Jesus of Galilee,\" she said. <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> But he denied it before them all. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said. <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, \"This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> He denied it again, with an oath: \"I don't know the man!\" <sup><strong>73</strong></sup> After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \"Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away.\" <sup><strong>74</strong></sup> Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, \"I don't know the man!\" <sup><strong>75</strong></sup> Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly. "}]}
