He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  <strong>29</strong> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:  <strong>30</strong> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  <strong>31</strong> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  <strong>32</strong> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.  <strong>33</strong> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a man is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Therefore do not be partners with them. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and find out what pleases the Lord. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: \"Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> for we are members of his body. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
