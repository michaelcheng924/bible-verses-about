Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest?  <strong>6</strong> Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.  <strong>7</strong> And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people, since they return not from their ways.  <strong>8</strong> Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.  <strong>9</strong> She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she hath been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.  <strong>11</strong> The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.  <strong>12</strong> Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?  <strong>13</strong> Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.  <strong>14</strong> And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn upon you.  <strong>15</strong> O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.  <strong>16</strong> Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.  <strong>17</strong> I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.  <strong>18</strong> Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, and as  waters that fail?  <strong>19</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.  <strong>20</strong> And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to me: \"Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my heart would not go out to this people. Send them away from my presence!

Who will mourn for you? Who will stop to ask how you are? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> You have rejected me,\" declares the LORD. \"You keep on backsliding. So I will lay hands on you and destroy you; I can no longer show compassion. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land. I will bring bereavement and destruction on my people, for they have not changed their ways. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. At midday I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men; suddenly I will bring down on them anguish and terror. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The mother of seven will grow faint and breathe her last. Her sun will set while it is still day; she will be disgraced and humiliated. I will put the survivors to the sword before their enemies,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Alas, my mother, that you gave me birth, a man with whom the whole land strives and contends! I have neither lent nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD said, \"Surely I will deliver you for a good purpose; surely I will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Can a man break iron- iron from the north-or bronze? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Your wealth and your treasures I will give as plunder, without charge, because of all your sins throughout your country. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know, for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You understand, O LORD; remember me and care for me. Avenge me on my persecutors. You are long-suffering-do not take me away; think of how I suffer reproach for your sake. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my heart's delight, for I bear your name, O LORD God Almighty. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I never sat in the company of revelers, never made merry with them; I sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable? Will you be to me like a deceptive brook, like a spring that fails? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD says: \"If you repent, I will restore you that you may serve me; if you utter worthy, not worthless, words, you will be my spokesman. Let this people turn to you, but you must not turn to them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue and save you,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"I will save you from the hands of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the cruel.\" "},{"_id":"615929cdcd920c662d0000a8","topicId":"615929cbcd920c662d0000a1","verse":"Genesis 1:1-31","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p01001001_06-7\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v01001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01001002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep.
