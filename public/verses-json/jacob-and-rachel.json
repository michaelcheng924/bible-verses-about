And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it.

He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.

And the Canaanite was then in the land.  <strong>7</strong> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.  <strong>8</strong> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.  <strong>10</strong> And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:  <strong>12</strong> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.  <strong>13</strong> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.  <strong>15</strong> The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.  <strong>16</strong> And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.  <strong>17</strong> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.  <strong>18</strong> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that  thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was  thy wife?  <strong>19</strong> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.  <strong>20</strong> And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
