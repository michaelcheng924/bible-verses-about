Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

I will remove savage beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your country. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers, and I will keep my covenant with you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You will still be eating last year's harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will put my dwelling place among you, and I will not abhor you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"'But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> then I will do this to you: I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and drain away your life. You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"'If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"'If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will multiply your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"'If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And I will bring the sword upon you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be given into enemy hands. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will dole out the bread by weight. You will eat, but you will not be satisfied. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"'If in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be hostile toward me, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> then in my anger I will be hostile toward you, and I myself will punish you for your sins seven times over. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> I will destroy your high places, cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols, and I will abhor you. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries, and I will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I will lay waste the land, so that your enemies who live there will be appalled. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you. Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"'As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight. They will run as though fleeing from the sword, and they will fall, even though no one is pursuing them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword, even though no one is pursuing them. So you will not be able to stand before your enemies. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also because of their fathers' sins they will waste away. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"'But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their fathers-their treachery against me and their hostility toward me, <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies-then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the LORD their God. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the LORD.'\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.
