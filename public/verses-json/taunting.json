You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You said in your heart, \"I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But you are brought down to the grave, to the depths of the pit. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: \"Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> the man who made the world a desert, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"I will rise up against them,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \"I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors, her offspring and descendants,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,\" declares the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn, \"Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Wail, O gate! Howl, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? \"The LORD has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.\" "},{"_id":"616b3c9dede035c13f9323be","topicId":"616b3c9bede035c13f9323bb","verse":"Revelation 1:7","votes":7,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p66001007_01-3\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66001007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him.
