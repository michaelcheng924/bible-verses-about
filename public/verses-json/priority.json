And this land will be your possession before the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, \"We your servants will do as our lord commands. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He said to them, \"If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, give them the land of Gilead as their possession. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The Gadites and Reubenites answered, \"Your servants will do what the LORD has said. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan-the whole land with its cities and the territory around them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.

I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword.
