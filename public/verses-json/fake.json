Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.  <strong>7</strong> Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,  <strong>8</strong> This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.  <strong>9</strong> But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. <strong>10</strong> And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:  <strong>11</strong> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.  <strong>12</strong> Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?  <strong>13</strong> But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.  <strong>14</strong> Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  <strong>15</strong> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  <strong>16</strong> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  <strong>17</strong> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  <strong>18</strong> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  <strong>19</strong> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:  <strong>20</strong> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. <strong>21</strong> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  <strong>23</strong> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  <strong>24</strong> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  <strong>25</strong> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.  <strong>26</strong> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.  <strong>27</strong> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.  <strong>28</strong> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is  thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.  <strong>30</strong> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:  <strong>31</strong> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.  <strong>33</strong> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  <strong>34</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?

They don't wash their hands before they eat!\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> he is not to 'honor his father 'with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you: <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen and understand. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then the disciples came to him and asked, \"Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He replied, \"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Leave them; they are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Peter said, \"Explain the parable to us.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Are you still so dull?\" Jesus asked them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man 'unclean.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> These are what make a man 'unclean'; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, \"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, \"Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The woman came and knelt before him. \"Lord, help me!\" she said. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He replied, \"It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she said, \"but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Jesus answered, \"Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.\" And her daughter was healed from that very hour. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> His disciples answered, \"Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"How many loaves do you have?\" Jesus asked. \"Seven,\" they replied, \"and a few small fish.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The number of those who ate was four thousand, besides women and children. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
