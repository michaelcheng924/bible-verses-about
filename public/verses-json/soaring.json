Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth!

Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree.

He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?\" says the Holy One. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, \"My way is hidden from the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God\"? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength.

my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass:  <strong>3</strong> Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God.  <strong>4</strong> He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.  <strong>5</strong> They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.  <strong>6</strong> Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is  not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?  <strong>7</strong> Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.  <strong>8</strong> When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.  <strong>9</strong> For the LORD’S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.  <strong>10</strong> He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.  <strong>11</strong> As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:  <strong>12</strong> So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.  <strong>13</strong> He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;  <strong>14</strong> Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.  <strong>15</strong> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.  <strong>16</strong> They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.  <strong>17</strong> They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.  <strong>18</strong> Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.  <strong>19</strong> And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.  <strong>20</strong> And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.  <strong>21</strong> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.  <strong>22</strong> For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  <strong>23</strong> I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  <strong>24</strong> They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.  <strong>25</strong> The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.  <strong>26</strong> I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:  <strong>27</strong> Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.  <strong>28</strong> For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.  <strong>29</strong> O that they were wise, that they understood this, that  they would consider their latter end!  <strong>30</strong> How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  <strong>31</strong> For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.  <strong>32</strong> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:  <strong>33</strong> Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.  <strong>34</strong> Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?  <strong>35</strong> To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.  <strong>36</strong> For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is  none shut up, or left.  <strong>37</strong> And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,  <strong>38</strong> Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.  <strong>39</strong> See now that I, even I, am he, and there is  no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.  <strong>40</strong> For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.  <strong>41</strong> If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.  <strong>42</strong> I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.  <strong>43</strong> Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.  <strong>44</strong> And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.  <strong>45</strong> And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:  <strong>46</strong> And he said unto them,

give unto the children of Israel for a possession:  <strong>50</strong> And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:  <strong>51</strong> Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in

He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled with food, he became heavy and sleek. He abandoned the God who made him and rejected the Rock his Savior. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They sacrificed to demons, which are not God- gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your fathers did not fear. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The LORD saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I will hide my face from them,\" he said, \"and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For a fire has been kindled by my wrath, one that burns to the realm of death below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"I will heap calamities upon them and spend my arrows against them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. Young men and young women will perish, infants and gray-haired men. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I said I would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the LORD has not done all this.'\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah.

In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He will say: \"Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?
