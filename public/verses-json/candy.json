When his life is half gone, they will desert him, and in the end he will prove to be a fool. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> A glorious throne, exalted from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> O LORD, the hope of Israel, all who forsake you will be put to shame. Those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the LORD, the spring of living water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Heal me, O LORD, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise.
