whose end is to be burned.  <strong>9</strong> But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.  <strong>10</strong> For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.  <strong>11</strong> And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:  <strong>12</strong> That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  <strong>13</strong> For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,  <strong>14</strong> Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.  <strong>15</strong> And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.  <strong>16</strong> For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.  <strong>17</strong> Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:  <strong>18</strong> That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:  <strong>19</strong> Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;  <strong>20</strong> Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And God permitting, we will do so. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case--things that accompany salvation. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> saying, \"I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.

Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
