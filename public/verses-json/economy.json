The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on oath, if you keep the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his ways. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will fear you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity-in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground-in the land he swore to your forefathers to give you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> However, if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you: <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The LORD will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The LORD will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> At midday you will grope about like a blind man in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and ravish her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The sights you see will drive you mad. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your fathers. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You will become a thing of horror and an object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations where the LORD will drive you. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, but you will be the tail. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The most gentle and sensitive woman among you-so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot-will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name-the LORD your God- <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods-gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> In the morning you will say, \"If only it were evening!\" and in the evening, \"If only it were morning!\"-because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.

It happened this way: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"I'm going out to fish,\" Simon Peter told them, and they said, \"We'll go with you.\" So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He called out to them, \"Friends, haven't you any fish?No,\" they answered. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said, \"Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\" When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \"It is the Lord!\" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, \"It is the Lord,\" he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Bring some of the fish you have just caught.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Come and have breakfast.\" None of the disciples dared ask him, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?Yes, Lord,\" he said, \"you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my lambs.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again Jesus said, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me?\" He answered, \"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Take care of my sheep.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The third time he said to him, \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" He said, \"Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Feed my sheep. I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, \"Follow me!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, \"Lord, who is going to betray you?\") <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Peter saw him, he asked, \"Lord, what about him?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.

from their reins.  <strong>3</strong> But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.  <strong>4</strong> How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.  <strong>5</strong> If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?  <strong>6</strong> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.  <strong>7</strong> I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.  <strong>8</strong> Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it.  <strong>9</strong> Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.  <strong>10</strong> Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.  <strong>11</strong> They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it  to heart.  <strong>12</strong> The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.  <strong>13</strong> They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.  <strong>15</strong> And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.  <strong>16</strong> And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my

Why do all the faithless live at ease? <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and bear fruit. You are always on their lips but far from their hearts. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Yet you know me, O LORD; you see me and test my thoughts about you. Drag them off like sheep to be butchered! Set them apart for the day of slaughter! <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> How long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered? Because those who live in it are wicked, the animals and birds have perished. Moreover, the people are saying, \"He will not see what happens to us.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in safe country, how will you manage in the thickets by the Jordan? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Your brothers, your own family- even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, though they speak well of you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"I will forsake my house, abandon my inheritance; I will give the one I love into the hands of her enemies. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest.

Go and gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field; they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It will be made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm, for the sword of the LORD will devour from one end of the land to the other; no one will be safe. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They will sow wheat but reap thorns; they will wear themselves out but gain nothing. So bear the shame of your harvest because of the LORD's fierce anger.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"As for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance I gave my people Israel, I will uproot them from their lands and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But after I uproot them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to his own inheritance and his own country. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name, saying, 'As surely as the LORD lives'-even as they once taught my people to swear by Baal-then they will be established among my people. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But if any nation does not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy it,\" declares the LORD.

So they went unto the city where the man of God was. <strong>11</strong>           And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?  <strong>12</strong> And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is  a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:  <strong>13</strong> As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden.

And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?  <strong>21</strong> And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?  <strong>22</strong> And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.  <strong>23</strong> And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.  <strong>24</strong> And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was  upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people.

And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.  <strong>27</strong> And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, \"Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the servant replied, \"Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true.

We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The servant answered him again. \"Look,\" he said, \"I have a quarter of a shekel of silver.

Why do you say such a thing to me?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited-about thirty in number. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Samuel said to the cook, \"Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, \"Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.'\" And Saul dined with Samuel that day. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, \"Get ready, and I will send you on your way.\" When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, \"Tell the servant to go on ahead of us\"-and the servant did so-\"but you stay here awhile, so that I may give you a message from God.\" "},{"_id":"61604ac1eb63b282e3fc35f1","topicId":"61604abbeb63b282e3fc35db","verse":"Revelation 13:1-18","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p66013001_04-24\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v66013001-1\">13:1&nbsp;</b>And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66013002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth.

Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.'\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Send this message to all the exiles: 'This is what the LORD says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has led you to believe a lie, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good things I will do for my people, declares the LORD, because he has preached rebellion against me.'\"
