And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.  <strong>5</strong> And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.  <strong>6</strong> And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.  <strong>7</strong> And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.  <strong>8</strong> Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;  <strong>10</strong> And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.  <strong>12</strong> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.  <strong>13</strong> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?  <strong>14</strong> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.  <strong>15</strong> Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.  <strong>16</strong> And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?  <strong>18</strong> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.  <strong>19</strong> When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.  <strong>20</strong> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.  <strong>21</strong> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.  <strong>22</strong> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.  <strong>23</strong> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  <strong>24</strong> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.  <strong>25</strong> Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.  <strong>26</strong> Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.  <strong>27</strong> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.  <strong>28</strong> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.  <strong>29</strong> And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it  upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!  <strong>30</strong> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.  <strong>31</strong> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.  <strong>32</strong> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.  <strong>33</strong> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,  <strong>34</strong> They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.  <strong>35</strong> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  <strong>36</strong> And sitting down they watched him there;  <strong>37</strong> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>38</strong> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.  <strong>39</strong> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,  <strong>40</strong> And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it  in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.  <strong>41</strong> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,  <strong>42</strong> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.  <strong>43</strong> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.  <strong>44</strong> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.  <strong>45</strong> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.  <strong>46</strong> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <strong>47</strong> Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.  <strong>48</strong> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  <strong>49</strong> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  <strong>51</strong> And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;  <strong>52</strong> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,  <strong>53</strong> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.  <strong>54</strong> Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.  <strong>55</strong> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  <strong>56</strong> Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.  <strong>57</strong> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:  <strong>58</strong> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.  <strong>59</strong> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  <strong>60</strong> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.  <strong>61</strong> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.  <strong>62</strong> Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  <strong>63</strong> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  <strong>64</strong> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.  <strong>65</strong> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it  as sure as ye can.  <strong>66</strong> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"I have sinned,\" he said, \"for I have betrayed innocent blood.What is that to us?\" they replied. \"That's your responsibility.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The chief priests picked up the coins and said, \"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Pilate asked him, \"Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \"Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: \"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\" asked the governor. \"Barabbas,\" they answered. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?\" Pilate asked. They all answered, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \"I am innocent of this man's blood,\" he said. \"It is your responsibility!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> All the people answered, \"Let his blood be on us and on our children!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" they said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> and saying, \"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The rest said, \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> \"Take a guard,\" Pilate answered. \"Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
