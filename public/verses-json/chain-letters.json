shall drive out Ashdod at the noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.  <strong>5</strong> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.  <strong>6</strong> And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds, and folds for flocks.  <strong>7</strong> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.  <strong>8</strong> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves  against their border.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.  <strong>10</strong> This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts.  <strong>11</strong> The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.  <strong>12</strong> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.  <strong>13</strong> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.  <strong>14</strong> And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.  <strong>15</strong> This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

The LORD their God will care for them; he will restore their fortunes. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I have heard the insults of Moab and the taunts of the Ammonites, who insulted my people and made threats against their land. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore, as surely as I live,\" declares the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, \"surely Moab will become like Sodom, the Ammonites like Gomorrah- a place of weeds and salt pits, a wasteland forever. The remnant of my people will plunder them; the survivors of my nation will inherit their land.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This is what they will get in return for their pride, for insulting and mocking the people of the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD will be awesome to them when he destroys all the gods of the land. The nations on every shore will worship him, every one in its own land. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"You too, O Cushites, will be slain by my sword.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy Assyria, leaving Nineveh utterly desolate and dry as the desert. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Flocks and herds will lie down there, creatures of every kind. The desert owl and the screech owl will roost on her columns. Their calls will echo through the windows, rubble will be in the doorways, the beams of cedar will be exposed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is the carefree city that lived in safety. She said to herself, \"I am, and there is none besides me.\" What a ruin she has become, a lair for wild beasts! All who pass by her scoff and shake their fists.

God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> As a dream comes when there are many cares, so the speech of a fool when there are many words. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it.

What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>For you have felt through all my goods; what have you found of all your household goods?

Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>There I was: by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed.

But what can I do this day for these my daughters or for their children whom they have borne? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031044-1\">44&nbsp;</b>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I. And let it be a witness between you and me.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031045-1\">45&nbsp;</b>So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031046-1\">46&nbsp;</b>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031047-1\">47&nbsp;</b>Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031048-1\">48&nbsp;</b>Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” Therefore he named it Galeed, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031049-1\">49&nbsp;</b>and Mizpah, for he said, “The LORD watch between you and me, when we are out of one another’s sight. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031050-1\">50&nbsp;</b>If you oppress my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us, see, God is witness between you and me.”</p>\n<p id=\"p01031050_05-19\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031051-1\">51&nbsp;</b>Then Laban said to Jacob, “See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031052-1\">52&nbsp;</b>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031053-1\">53&nbsp;</b>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01031054-1\">54&nbsp;</b>and Jacob offered a sacrifice in the hill country and called his kinsmen to eat bread.

Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.  <strong>26</strong> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken  with the sword?  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?  <strong>28</strong> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.  <strong>29</strong> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.  <strong>30</strong> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?  <strong>31</strong> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.  <strong>32</strong> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it  to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.  <strong>33</strong> And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.  <strong>34</strong> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them  not.  <strong>35</strong> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.  <strong>36</strong> And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?  <strong>37</strong> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.  <strong>38</strong> This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.  <strong>39</strong> That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night.  <strong>40</strong> Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.  <strong>41</strong> Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.  <strong>42</strong> Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.  <strong>43</strong> And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?  <strong>44</strong> Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.  <strong>45</strong> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.  <strong>46</strong> And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.  <strong>47</strong> And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.  <strong>48</strong> And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;  <strong>49</strong> And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.  <strong>50</strong> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other  wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.  <strong>51</strong> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this  pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;  <strong>52</strong> This heap be witness, and this pillar be  witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.  <strong>53</strong> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.  <strong>54</strong> Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount.  <strong>55</strong> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, \"Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him was not what it had been. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Jacob, \"Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He said to them, \"I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If he said, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, 'The streaked ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks bore streaked young. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So God has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob.' I answered, 'Here I am.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And he said, 'Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.'\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Rachel and Leah replied, \"Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So he fled with all he had, and crossing the River, he headed for the hill country of Gilead. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, \"Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Laban said to Jacob, \"What have you done? You've deceived me, and you've carried off my daughters like captives in war. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-by. You have done a foolish thing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father's house. But why did you steal my gods?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Jacob answered Laban, \"I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But if you find anyone who has your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.\" Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Rachel said to her father, \"Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period.\" So he searched but could not find the household gods. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. \"What is my crime?\" he asked Laban. \"What sin have I committed that you hunt me down? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Laban answered Jacob, \"The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne? <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He said to his relatives, \"Gather some stones.\" So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Laban said, \"This heap is a witness between you and me today.\" That is why it was called Galeed. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> It was also called Mizpah, because he said, \"May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Laban also said to Jacob, \"Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.\" So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.

But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  <strong>7</strong> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  <strong>8</strong> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.  <strong>9</strong> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own  conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even  unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.  <strong>10</strong> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?  <strong>11</strong> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. <strong>12</strong> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.  <strong>13</strong> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.  <strong>14</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.  <strong>15</strong> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.  <strong>16</strong> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.  <strong>17</strong> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.  <strong>18</strong> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.  <strong>19</strong> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.  <strong>20</strong> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>22</strong> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>23</strong> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.  <strong>24</strong> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.  <strong>25</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.  <strong>26</strong> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.  <strong>27</strong> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.  <strong>28</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.  <strong>29</strong> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.  <strong>30</strong> As he spake these words, many believed on him.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;  <strong>32</strong> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  <strong>33</strong> They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.  <strong>35</strong> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but  the Son abideth ever.  <strong>36</strong> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.  <strong>37</strong> I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.  <strong>38</strong> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.  <strong>39</strong> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.  <strong>40</strong> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.  <strong>41</strong> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.  <strong>42</strong> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.  <strong>43</strong> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.  <strong>44</strong> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your  father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.  <strong>45</strong> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.  <strong>46</strong> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?  <strong>47</strong> He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them  not, because ye are not of God.  <strong>48</strong> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  <strong>49</strong> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.  <strong>50</strong> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.  <strong>51</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.  <strong>52</strong> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.  <strong>53</strong> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  <strong>54</strong> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:  <strong>55</strong> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.  <strong>56</strong> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it,  and was glad.  <strong>57</strong> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  <strong>58</strong> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.  <strong>59</strong> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"No one, sir,\" she said. \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The Pharisees challenged him, \"Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"Where is your father?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You do not know me or my Father,\" Jesus replied. \"If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\" He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Once more Jesus said to them, \"I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> This made the Jews ask, \"Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But he continued, \"You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Who are you?\" they asked. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Just what I have been claiming all along,\" Jesus replied. \"I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So Jesus said, \"When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They answered him, \"We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father. \" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Abraham is our father,\" they answered. \"If you were Abraham's children,\" said Jesus, \"then you would <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> do the things Abraham did. As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> You are doing the things your own father does.We are not illegitimate children,\" they protested. \"The only Father we have is God himself.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The Jews answered him, \"Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"I am not possessed by a demon,\" said Jesus, \"but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> At this the Jews exclaimed, \"Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> \"You are not yet fifty years old,\" the Jews said to him, \"and you have seen Abraham!\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"before Abraham was born, I am!\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
