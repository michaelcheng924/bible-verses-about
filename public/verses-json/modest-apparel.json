He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.

In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
