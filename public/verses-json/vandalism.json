And they said, Nothing.  <strong>36</strong> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.  <strong>37</strong> For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.  <strong>38</strong> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. <strong>39</strong> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.  <strong>40</strong> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.  <strong>41</strong> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,  <strong>42</strong> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.  <strong>43</strong> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.  <strong>44</strong> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.  <strong>45</strong> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,  <strong>46</strong> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. <strong>47</strong> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.  <strong>48</strong> But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?  <strong>49</strong> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?  <strong>50</strong> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.  <strong>52</strong> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?  <strong>53</strong> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. <strong>54</strong> Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.  <strong>55</strong> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.  <strong>56</strong> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.  <strong>57</strong> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.  <strong>58</strong> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.  <strong>59</strong> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.  <strong>60</strong> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.  <strong>61</strong> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>62</strong> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.  <strong>63</strong> And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.  <strong>64</strong> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?  <strong>65</strong> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.  <strong>66</strong> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,  <strong>67</strong> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:  <strong>68</strong> And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.  <strong>69</strong> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.  <strong>70</strong> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.  <strong>71</strong> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They were delighted and agreed to give him money. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Where do you want us to prepare for it?\" they asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He replied, \"As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And he said to them, \"I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, \"Take this and divide it among you. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, \"This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You are those who have stood by me in my trials. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But he replied, \"Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus asked them, \"When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?Nothing,\" they answered. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He said to them, \"But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> It is written: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The disciples said, \"See, Lord, here are two swords.That is enough,\" he replied. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> On reaching the place, he said to them, \"Pray that you will not fall into temptation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Why are you sleeping?\" he asked them. \"Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> but Jesus asked him, \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, \"Lord, should we strike with our swords?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> But Jesus answered, \"No more of this!\" And he touched the man's ear and healed him. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, \"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, \"This man was with him.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"Woman, I don't know him,\" he said. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> A little later someone else saw him and said, \"You also are one of them.Man, I am not!\" Peter replied. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> About an hour later another asserted, \"Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Man, I don't know what you're talking about!\" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> And he went outside and wept bitterly. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> They blindfolded him and demanded, \"Prophesy! Who hit you?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> And they said many other insulting things to him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"If you are the Christ, \"they said, \"tell us.\" <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> They all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied, \"You are right in saying I am.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> Then they said, \"Why do we need any more testimony?

he will render unto her a recompence.  <strong>7</strong> Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD’S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.  <strong>8</strong> Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.  <strong>9</strong> We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.  <strong>10</strong> The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.  <strong>11</strong> Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.  <strong>12</strong> Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.  <strong>15</strong> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.  <strong>16</strong> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.  <strong>17</strong> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  <strong>18</strong> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <strong>19</strong> The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is  the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>20</strong> Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;  <strong>21</strong> And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;  <strong>22</strong> With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;  <strong>23</strong> I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.  <strong>24</strong> And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.  <strong>25</strong> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.  <strong>28</strong> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.  <strong>29</strong> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.  <strong>30</strong> The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.  <strong>31</strong> One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,  <strong>32</strong> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.  <strong>33</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.  <strong>34</strong> Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.  <strong>35</strong> The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.  <strong>37</strong> And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.  <strong>38</strong> They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps.  <strong>39</strong> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.  <strong>40</strong> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.  <strong>41</strong> How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!  <strong>42</strong> The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.  <strong>43</strong> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.  <strong>44</strong> And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.  <strong>45</strong> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.  <strong>46</strong> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.  <strong>47</strong> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.  <strong>48</strong> Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.  <strong>49</strong> As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.  <strong>50</strong> Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.  <strong>51</strong> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house.  <strong>52</strong> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.  <strong>53</strong> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.  <strong>54</strong> A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:  <strong>55</strong> Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:  <strong>56</strong> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.  <strong>57</strong> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.  <strong>58</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.  <strong>59</strong> The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.  <strong>60</strong> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.  <strong>61</strong> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;  <strong>62</strong> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.  <strong>63</strong> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:  <strong>64</strong> And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are  the words of Jeremiah.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"See, I will stir up the spirit of a destroyer against Babylon and the people of Leb Kamai. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I will send foreigners to Babylon to winnow her and to devastate her land; they will oppose her on every side in the day of her disaster. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Let not the archer string his bow, nor let him put on his armor. Do not spare her young men; completely destroy her army. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They will fall down slain in Babylon, fatally wounded in her streets. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For Israel and Judah have not been forsaken by their God, the LORD Almighty, though their land is full of guilt before the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Flee from Babylon! Run for your lives! Do not be destroyed because of her sins. It is time for the LORD's vengeance; he will pay her what she deserves. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Babylon was a gold cup in the LORD's hand; she made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore they have now gone mad. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Babylon will suddenly fall and be broken. Wail over her! Get balm for her pain; perhaps she can be healed. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'We would have healed Babylon, but she cannot be healed; let us leave her and each go to his own land, for her judgment reaches to the skies, it rises as high as the clouds.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"'The LORD has vindicated us; come, let us tell in Zion what the LORD our God has done.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Sharpen the arrows, take up the shields! The LORD has stirred up the kings of the Medes, because his purpose is to destroy Babylon. The LORD will take vengeance, vengeance for his temple. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Lift up a banner against the walls of Babylon! Reinforce the guard, station the watchmen, prepare an ambush! The LORD will carry out his purpose, his decree against the people of Babylon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You who live by many waters and are rich in treasures, your end has come, the time for you to be cut off. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn by himself: I will surely fill you with men, as with a swarm of locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"He made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Every man is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud; they have no breath in them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including the tribe of his inheritance- the LORD Almighty is his name. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You are my war club, my weapon for battle- with you I shatter nations, with you I destroy kingdoms, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> with you I shatter horse and rider, with you I shatter chariot and driver, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> with you I shatter man and woman, with you I shatter old man and youth, with you I shatter young man and maiden, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> with you I shatter shepherd and flock, with you I shatter farmer and oxen, with you I shatter governors and officials. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Before your eyes I will repay Babylon and all who live in Babylonia for all the wrong they have done in Zion,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I am against you, O destroying mountain, you who destroy the whole earth,\" declares the LORD. \"I will stretch out my hand against you, roll you off the cliffs, and make you a burned-out mountain. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> No rock will be taken from you for a cornerstone, nor any stone for a foundation, for you will be desolate forever,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Lift up a banner in the land! Blow the trumpet among the nations! Prepare the nations for battle against her; summon against her these kingdoms: Ararat, Minni and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander against her; send up horses like a swarm of locusts. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Prepare the nations for battle against her- the kings of the Medes, their governors and all their officials, and all the countries they rule. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The land trembles and writhes, for the LORD's purposes against Babylon stand- to lay waste the land of Babylon so that no one will live there. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Babylon's warriors have stopped fighting; they remain in their strongholds. Their strength is exhausted; they have become like women. Her dwellings are set on fire; the bars of her gates are broken. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One courier follows another and messenger follows messenger to announce to the king of Babylon that his entire city is captured, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> the river crossings seized, the marshes set on fire, and the soldiers terrified.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"The Daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time it is trampled; the time to harvest her will soon come.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured us, he has thrown us into confusion, he has made us an empty jar. Like a serpent he has swallowed us and filled his stomach with our delicacies, and then has spewed us out. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> May the violence done to our flesh be upon Babylon,\" say the inhabitants of Zion. \"May our blood be on those who live in Babylonia,\" says Jerusalem. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says: \"See, I will defend your cause and avenge you; I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Babylon will be a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, an object of horror and scorn, a place where no one lives. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Her people all roar like young lions, they growl like lion cubs. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But while they are aroused, I will set out a feast for them and make them drunk, so that they shout with laughter- then sleep forever and not awake,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"How Sheshach will be captured, the boast of the whole earth seized! What a horror Babylon will be among the nations! <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The sea will rise over Babylon; its roaring waves will cover her. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Her towns will be desolate, a dry and desert land, a land where no one lives, through which no man travels. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. The nations will no longer stream to him. And the wall of Babylon will fall. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Come out of her, my people! Run for your lives! Run from the fierce anger of the LORD. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Do not lose heart or be afraid when rumors are heard in the land; one rumor comes this year, another the next, rumors of violence in the land and of ruler against ruler. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> For the time will surely come when I will punish the idols of Babylon; her whole land will be disgraced and her slain will all lie fallen within her. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then heaven and earth and all that is in them will shout for joy over Babylon, for out of the north destroyers will attack her,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"Babylon must fall because of Israel's slain, just as the slain in all the earth have fallen because of Babylon. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> You who have escaped the sword, leave and do not linger! Remember the LORD in a distant land, and think on Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"We are disgraced, for we have been insulted and shame covers our faces, because foreigners have entered the holy places of the LORD's house.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"But days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Even if Babylon reaches the sky and fortifies her lofty stronghold, I will send destroyers against her,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> \"The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The LORD will destroy Babylon; he will silence her noisy din. Waves of enemies will rage like great waters; the roar of their voices will resound. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> A destroyer will come against Babylon; her warriors will be captured, and their bows will be broken. For the LORD is a God of retribution; he will repay in full. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> I will make her officials and wise men drunk, her governors, officers and warriors as well; they will sleep forever and not awake,\" declares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"Babylon's thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire; the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing, the nations' labor is only fuel for the flames.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> This is the message Jeremiah gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon-all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> He said to Seraiah, \"When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Then say, 'O LORD, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither man nor animal will live in it; it will be desolate forever.' <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Then say, 'So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring upon her. And her people will fall.'\" The words of Jeremiah end here.

and so hate thee.  <strong>18</strong> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is  a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.  <strong>19</strong> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like  a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.  <strong>20</strong> As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as  vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.  <strong>21</strong> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:  <strong>22</strong> For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.  <strong>23</strong> The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.  <strong>24</strong> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.  <strong>25</strong> As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.  <strong>26</strong> A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.  <strong>27</strong> It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.  <strong>28</strong> He
