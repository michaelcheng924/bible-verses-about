When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Tell them this: 'These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud; they have no breath in them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the tribe of his inheritance- the LORD Almighty is his name. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this is what the LORD says: \"At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, \"This is my sickness, and I must endure it.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My sons are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the LORD; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Listen! The report is coming- a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I know, O LORD, that a man's life is not his own; it is not for man to direct his steps. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Correct me, LORD, but only with justice- not in your anger, lest you reduce me to nothing. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.

","niv":"<sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\"--which means, \"God with us.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
