is  not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee?  <strong>7</strong> Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee.  <strong>8</strong> When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.  <strong>9</strong> For the LORD’S portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.  <strong>10</strong> He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.  <strong>11</strong> As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:  <strong>12</strong> So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.  <strong>13</strong> He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;  <strong>14</strong> Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.  <strong>15</strong> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.  <strong>16</strong> They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.  <strong>17</strong> They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.  <strong>18</strong> Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.  <strong>19</strong> And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.  <strong>20</strong> And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.  <strong>21</strong> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.  <strong>22</strong> For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  <strong>23</strong> I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  <strong>24</strong> They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.  <strong>25</strong> The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.  <strong>26</strong> I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:  <strong>27</strong> Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.  <strong>28</strong> For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.  <strong>29</strong> O that they were wise, that they understood this, that  they would consider their latter end!  <strong>30</strong> How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  <strong>31</strong> For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.  <strong>32</strong> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:  <strong>33</strong> Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.  <strong>34</strong> Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?  <strong>35</strong> To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.  <strong>36</strong> For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is  none shut up, or left.  <strong>37</strong> And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,  <strong>38</strong> Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.  <strong>39</strong> See now that I, even I, am he, and there is  no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.  <strong>40</strong> For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.  <strong>41</strong> If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.  <strong>42</strong> I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.  <strong>43</strong> Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.  <strong>44</strong> And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.  <strong>45</strong> And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:  <strong>46</strong> And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.  <strong>47</strong> For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is  your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.  <strong>48</strong> And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,  <strong>49</strong> Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:  <strong>50</strong> And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:  <strong>51</strong> Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.  <strong>52</strong> Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They have acted corruptly toward him; to their shame they are no longer his children, but a warped and crooked generation. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Is this the way you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For the LORD's portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled with food, he became heavy and sleek. He abandoned the God who made him and rejected the Rock his Savior. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They sacrificed to demons, which are not God- gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your fathers did not fear. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The LORD saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I will hide my face from them,\" he said, \"and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For a fire has been kindled by my wrath, one that burns to the realm of death below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"I will heap calamities upon them and spend my arrows against them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. Young men and young women will perish, infants and gray-haired men. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I said I would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the LORD has not done all this.'\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults? <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He will say: \"Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up to help you! Let them give you shelter! <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"See now that I myself am He! There is no god besides me.

By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> On that same day the LORD told Moses, <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel.\" ","modified":"2023-07-07T08:10:36.939Z"},{"_id":"6158ed482ee2ce61bea42a5a","topicId":"6158ed412ee2ce61bea42a43","verse":"Genesis 1:29","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p01001029_01-23\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01001029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit.
