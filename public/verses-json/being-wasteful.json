But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
