Live as children of light <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and find out what pleases the Lord. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said: \"Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> for we are members of his body. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.  <strong>28</strong> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.  <strong>29</strong> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.  <strong>30</strong> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.  <strong>31</strong> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.  <strong>32</strong> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men  unto me.  <strong>33</strong> This he said, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>34</strong> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?  who is this Son of man?  <strong>35</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.  <strong>36</strong> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.  <strong>37</strong> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:  <strong>38</strong> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  <strong>39</strong> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,  <strong>40</strong> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  <strong>41</strong> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.  <strong>42</strong> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:  <strong>43</strong> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.  <strong>44</strong> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.  <strong>45</strong> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.  <strong>46</strong> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.  <strong>47</strong> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.  <strong>48</strong> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.  <strong>49</strong> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  <strong>50</strong> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. \" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" Jesus replied. \"It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the Pharisees said to one another, \"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Father, glorify your name!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.\" The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"This voice was for your benefit, not mine. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\" When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: \"Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then Jesus cried out, \"When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him.

It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Take away the stone,\" he said. \"But, Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"What are we accomplishing?\" they asked. \"Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, \"You know nothing at all! <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> So from that day on they plotted to take his life. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, \"What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.
