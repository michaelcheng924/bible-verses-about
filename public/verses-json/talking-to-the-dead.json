And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.  <strong>15</strong> And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.  <strong>16</strong> Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?  <strong>17</strong> And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, even  to David:  <strong>18</strong> Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.  <strong>19</strong> Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be  with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.  <strong>20</strong> Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.  <strong>21</strong> And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.  <strong>22</strong> Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.  <strong>23</strong> But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.  <strong>24</strong> And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:  <strong>25</strong> And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, \"You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> David said, \"Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.\" Achish replied, \"Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Saul then said to his attendants, \"Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.There is one in Endor,\" they said. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. \"Consult a spirit for me,\" he said, \"and bring up for me the one I name.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But the woman said to him, \"Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Saul swore to her by the LORD, \"As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then the woman asked, \"Whom shall I bring up for you?Bring up Samuel,\" he said. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, \"Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The king said to her, \"Don't be afraid. What do you see?\" The woman said, \"I see a spirit coming up out of the ground.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"What does he look like?\" he asked. \"An old man wearing a robe is coming up,\" she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Samuel said to Saul, \"Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?I am in great distress,\" Saul said. \"The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Samuel said, \"Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors-to David. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The LORD will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, \"Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He refused and said, \"I will not eat.\" But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.
