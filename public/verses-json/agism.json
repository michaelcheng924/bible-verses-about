And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none but me. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked: Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They will say of me, 'In the LORD alone are righteousness and strength.'\" All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But in the LORD all the descendants of Israel will be found righteous and will exult.
