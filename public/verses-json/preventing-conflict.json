together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.  <strong>39</strong> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is  their strength in the time of trouble.  <strong>40</strong> And the LORD shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of those who do wrong; <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Trust in the LORD and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret-it leads only to evil. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked; <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the wicked will perish: The LORD's enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish-vanish like smoke. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously; <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm; <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off; <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives; <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future for the man of peace. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But all sinners will be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
