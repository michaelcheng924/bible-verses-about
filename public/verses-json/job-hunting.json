Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.  <strong>6</strong> Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them.  <strong>7</strong> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that  I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.  <strong>8</strong> Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  <strong>10</strong> They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.  <strong>12</strong> Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.  <strong>13</strong> For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.  <strong>15</strong> What hath my beloved to do in mine house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.  <strong>16</strong> The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.  <strong>17</strong> For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou shewedst me their doings.  <strong>19</strong> But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.  <strong>20</strong> But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.  <strong>21</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our hand:  <strong>22</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:  <strong>23</strong> And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.

Both the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken the covenant I made with their forefathers. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD says: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape.

 <strong>5</strong> Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;  <strong>6</strong> Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters;

 <strong>17</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.  <strong>18</strong> And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:  <strong>19</strong> Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them;

Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;  <strong>22</strong> And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;

 and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  <strong>29</strong> And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.  <strong>30</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>31</strong> Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite;

Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will be found by you,\" declares the LORD, \"and will bring you back from captivity.

And you exiles have not listened either,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: \"I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: 'The LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and in my name have spoken lies, which I did not tell them to do. I know it and am a witness to it,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the other priests.

Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.'\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Send this message to all the exiles: 'This is what the LORD says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has led you to believe a lie, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants.
