And they murmured against her.  <strong>6</strong> And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.  <strong>7</strong> For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.  <strong>8</strong> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.  <strong>9</strong> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. <strong>10</strong> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.  <strong>11</strong> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.  <strong>12</strong> And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  <strong>13</strong> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.  <strong>14</strong> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  <strong>15</strong> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and  prepared: there make ready for us.  <strong>16</strong> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.  <strong>17</strong> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.  <strong>18</strong> And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.  <strong>19</strong> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?  <strong>20</strong> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.  <strong>21</strong> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. <strong>22</strong> And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.  <strong>23</strong> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it  to them: and they all drank of it.  <strong>24</strong> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.  <strong>25</strong> Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. <strong>26</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.  <strong>28</strong> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>29</strong> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will  not I.  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>31</strong> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.  <strong>32</strong> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.  <strong>33</strong> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;  <strong>34</strong> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.  <strong>35</strong> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.  <strong>36</strong> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.  <strong>37</strong> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  <strong>38</strong> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>39</strong> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.  <strong>40</strong> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.  <strong>41</strong> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>42</strong> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. <strong>43</strong> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.  <strong>44</strong> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.  <strong>45</strong> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.  <strong>46</strong> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.  <strong>47</strong> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  <strong>48</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?  <strong>49</strong> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.  <strong>50</strong> And they all forsook him, and fled.  <strong>51</strong> And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:  <strong>52</strong> And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.  <strong>53</strong> And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.  <strong>54</strong> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.  <strong>55</strong> And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.  <strong>56</strong> For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.  <strong>57</strong> And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,  <strong>58</strong> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.  <strong>59</strong> But neither so did their witness agree together.  <strong>60</strong> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>61</strong> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?  <strong>62</strong> And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>63</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?  <strong>64</strong> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.  <strong>65</strong> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.  <strong>66</strong> And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:  <strong>67</strong> And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>68</strong> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.  <strong>69</strong> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.  <strong>70</strong> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.  <strong>71</strong> But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.  <strong>72</strong> And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"But not during the Feast,\" they said, \"or the people may riot.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, \"Why this waste of perfume? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor.\" And they rebuked her harshly. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" said Jesus. \"Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, \"Surely not I?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"It is one of the Twelve,\" he replied, \"one who dips bread into the bowl with me. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take it; this is my body.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,\" he said to them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You will all fall away,\" Jesus told them, \"for it is written: \"'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Peter declared, \"Even if all fall away, I will not.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Peter insisted emphatically, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the others said the same. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,\" he said to them. \"Stay here and keep watch.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Abba, Father,\" he said, \"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Simon,\" he said to Peter, \"are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Returning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Then everyone deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> \"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. \"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.

glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.  <strong>2</strong> Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?  <strong>3</strong> I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was  none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.  <strong>4</strong> For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.  <strong>5</strong> And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.  <strong>6</strong> And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.  <strong>7</strong> I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.  <strong>8</strong> For he said, Surely they are my people, children that  will not lie: so he was their Saviour.  <strong>9</strong> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.  <strong>10</strong> But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.  <strong>11</strong> Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him?  <strong>12</strong> That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?  <strong>13</strong> That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?  <strong>14</strong> As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.  <strong>15</strong> Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?  <strong>16</strong> Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.  <strong>17</strong> O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.  <strong>18</strong> The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.  <strong>19</strong> We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength? \"It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redemption has come. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I will tell of the kindnesses of the LORD, the deeds for which he is to be praised, according to all the LORD has done for us- yes, the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, according to his compassion and many kindnesses. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He said, \"Surely they are my people, sons who will not be false to me\"; and so he became their Savior. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then his people recalled the days of old, the days of Moses and his people- where is he who brought them through the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses' right hand, who divided the waters before them, to gain for himself everlasting renown, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> like cattle that go down to the plain, they were given rest by the Spirit of the LORD. This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Look down from heaven and see from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. Where are your zeal and your might? Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Why, O LORD, do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes that are your inheritance. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For a little while your people possessed your holy place, but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> We are yours from of old; but you have not ruled over them, they have not been called by your name.
