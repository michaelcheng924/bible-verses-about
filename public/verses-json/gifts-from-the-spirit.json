I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014019_04-8\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God.

He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So it is with you.

So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, \"God is really among you!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.

If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  <strong>18</strong> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.  <strong>19</strong> And if they were all one member, where were the body?  <strong>20</strong> But now are they many members, yet but one body.  <strong>21</strong> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.  <strong>22</strong> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:  <strong>23</strong> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.  <strong>24</strong> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:  <strong>25</strong> That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.  <strong>26</strong> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.  <strong>27</strong> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.  <strong>28</strong> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.  <strong>29</strong> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are  all teachers? are all workers of miracles?  <strong>30</strong> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?  <strong>31</strong> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, \"Jesus be cursed,\" and no one can say, \"Jesus is Lord,\" except by the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free--and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If the foot should say, \"Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And if the ear should say, \"Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If they were all one part, where would the body be? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> As it is, there are many parts, but one body. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I don't need you!\" And the head cannot say to the feet, \"I don't need you!\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.
