also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>15</strong> Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.  <strong>16</strong> Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.  <strong>17</strong> For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.  <strong>18</strong> Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.  <strong>19</strong> The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.  <strong>20</strong> Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.  <strong>21</strong> Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.  <strong>22</strong> A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

He is Micaiah son of Imlah.The king should not say that,\" Jehoshaphat replied. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, \"Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, \"This is what the LORD says: 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. \"Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,\" they said, \"for the LORD will give it into the king's hand.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, \"Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Micaiah said, \"As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what the LORD tells me.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When he arrived, the king asked him, \"Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?Attack and be victorious,\" he answered, \"for the LORD will give it into the king's hand.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The king said to him, \"How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Micaiah answered, \"I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Micaiah continued, \"Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?'\"One suggested this, and another that. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"'By what means?' the LORD asked. \"'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. \"'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. \"Which way did the spirit from the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?\" he asked. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Micaiah replied, \"You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king of Israel then ordered, \"Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and say, 'This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Micaiah declared, \"If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me.\" Then he added, \"Mark my words, all you people!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, \"I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.\" So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, \"Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, \"Surely this is the king of Israel.\" So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, \"Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army: \"Every man to his town; everyone to his land!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> As for the other events of Ahab's reign, including all he did, the palace he built and inlaid with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> In everything he walked in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> As for the other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> There was then no king in Edom; a deputy ruled. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail-they were wrecked at Ezion Geber. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, \"Let my men sail with your men,\" but Jehoshaphat refused. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> He served and worshiped Baal and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done.

And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.  <strong>33</strong> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.  <strong>34</strong> And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.  <strong>35</strong> And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.  <strong>36</strong> And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.  <strong>37</strong> So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.  <strong>38</strong> And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.  <strong>39</strong> Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <strong>40</strong> So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.  <strong>41</strong> And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.  <strong>42</strong> Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.  <strong>43</strong> And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.  <strong>44</strong> And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.  <strong>45</strong> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?  <strong>46</strong> And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.  <strong>47</strong> There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.  <strong>48</strong> Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.  <strong>49</strong> Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.  <strong>50</strong> And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.  <strong>51</strong> Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.  <strong>52</strong> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:  <strong>53</strong> For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.

and he was the only officer which was in the land.  <strong>20</strong> Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is  by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.  <strong>21</strong> And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.  <strong>22</strong> And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,  <strong>23</strong> Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.  <strong>24</strong> For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.  <strong>25</strong> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.  <strong>26</strong> And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.  <strong>27</strong> And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.  <strong>28</strong> Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.  <strong>29</strong> And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.  <strong>30</strong> And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.  <strong>31</strong> For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.  <strong>32</strong> And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.  <strong>33</strong> And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.  <strong>34</strong> And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.  <strong>1</strong> And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.  <strong>2</strong> And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,  <strong>3</strong> Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.  <strong>4</strong> But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.  <strong>5</strong> And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.  <strong>6</strong> Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.  <strong>7</strong> And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.  <strong>8</strong> And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.  <strong>9</strong> My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.  <strong>10</strong> So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to  all his desire.  <strong>11</strong> And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for  food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.  <strong>12</strong> And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.  <strong>13</strong> And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.  <strong>14</strong> And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.  <strong>15</strong> And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;  <strong>16</strong> Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.  <strong>17</strong> And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.  <strong>18</strong> And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them,  and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,  and the height thereof thirty cubits.  <strong>3</strong> And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was  the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and  ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.  <strong>4</strong> And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.  <strong>5</strong> And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:  <strong>6</strong> The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.  <strong>7</strong> And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.  <strong>8</strong> The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,  and out of the middle into the third.  <strong>9</strong> So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.  <strong>10</strong> And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.  <strong>11</strong> And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,  <strong>12</strong> Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:  <strong>13</strong> And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.  <strong>14</strong> So Solomon built the house, and finished it.  <strong>15</strong> And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.  <strong>16</strong> And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.  <strong>17</strong> And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.  <strong>18</strong> And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.  <strong>19</strong> And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.  <strong>20</strong> And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of  cedar.  <strong>21</strong> So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.  <strong>22</strong> And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.  <strong>23</strong> And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.  <strong>24</strong> And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.  <strong>25</strong> And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.  <strong>26</strong> The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.  <strong>27</strong> And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.  <strong>28</strong> And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.  <strong>29</strong> And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.  <strong>30</strong> And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.  <strong>31</strong> And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.  <strong>32</strong> The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.  <strong>33</strong> So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.  <strong>34</strong> And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were  folding.  <strong>35</strong> And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.  <strong>36</strong> And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.  <strong>37</strong> In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:  <strong>38</strong> And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.

Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind;  <strong>2</strong> And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.  <strong>3</strong> Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host.  <strong>4</strong> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets.  <strong>5</strong> For Israel hath not been forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD’S vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence.  <strong>7</strong> Babylon hath been a golden cup in the LORD’S hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.  <strong>8</strong> Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.  <strong>9</strong> We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.  <strong>10</strong> The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.  <strong>11</strong> Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.  <strong>12</strong> Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee.  <strong>15</strong> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding.  <strong>16</strong> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.  <strong>17</strong> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  <strong>18</strong> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <strong>19</strong> The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is  the former of all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>20</strong> Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms;  <strong>21</strong> And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider;  <strong>22</strong> With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid;  <strong>23</strong> I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers.  <strong>24</strong> And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD.  <strong>25</strong> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.  <strong>28</strong> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion.  <strong>29</strong> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.  <strong>30</strong> The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.  <strong>31</strong> One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,  <strong>32</strong> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.  <strong>33</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.  <strong>34</strong> Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.  <strong>35</strong> The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry.  <strong>37</strong> And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant.  <strong>38</strong> They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps.  <strong>39</strong> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD.  <strong>40</strong> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.  <strong>41</strong> How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations!  <strong>42</strong> The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.  <strong>43</strong> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby.  <strong>44</strong> And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.  <strong>45</strong> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD.  <strong>46</strong> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.  <strong>47</strong> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.  <strong>48</strong> Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD.  <strong>49</strong> As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.  <strong>50</strong> Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.  <strong>51</strong> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house.  <strong>52</strong> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.  <strong>53</strong> Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD.  <strong>54</strong> A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:  <strong>55</strong> Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:  <strong>56</strong> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite.  <strong>57</strong> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.  <strong>58</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.  <strong>59</strong> The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.  <strong>60</strong> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.  <strong>61</strong> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;  <strong>62</strong> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.  <strong>63</strong> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:  <strong>64</strong> And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are  the words of Jeremiah.  "}]}
