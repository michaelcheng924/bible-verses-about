No one was strong enough to subdue him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For Jesus had said to him, \"Come out of this man, you evil spirit!\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"My name is Legion,\" he replied, \"for we are many.\" And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The demons begged Jesus, \"Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So Jesus went with him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher any more?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But they laughed at him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, \"Talitha koum!\" (which means, \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\" ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.

They cannot, so long as they have him with them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment.

And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.  <strong>3</strong> Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field;  <strong>4</strong> And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.  <strong>5</strong> Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,  <strong>6</strong> Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:  <strong>7</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.  <strong>8</strong> For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.  <strong>9</strong> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.  <strong>10</strong> Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,  <strong>11</strong> Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.  <strong>12</strong> But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?  <strong>14</strong> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  <strong>15</strong> Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and choose the good.  <strong>16</strong> For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.  <strong>17</strong> The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.  <strong>18</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.  <strong>19</strong> And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes.  <strong>20</strong> In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep;  <strong>22</strong> And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that  they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.  <strong>23</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.  <strong>24</strong> With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land shall become briers and thorns.  <strong>25</strong> And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.

All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.
