","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.  <strong>9</strong> All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.  <strong>10</strong> And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.  <strong>11</strong> And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.  <strong>12</strong> And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.  <strong>13</strong> And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.  <strong>14</strong> He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.  <strong>15</strong> For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.  <strong>16</strong> And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:  <strong>17</strong> And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.  <strong>18</strong> And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.  <strong>19</strong> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.  <strong>20</strong> And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.  <strong>21</strong> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.  <strong>22</strong> And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.  <strong>23</strong> And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.  <strong>24</strong> And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.  <strong>25</strong> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.  <strong>26</strong> And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.  <strong>27</strong> And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.  <strong>28</strong> And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:  <strong>29</strong> And on the borders that were between the ledges were  lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was  a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.  <strong>30</strong> And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.  <strong>31</strong> And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.  <strong>32</strong> And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit.  <strong>33</strong> And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were  all molten.  <strong>34</strong> And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.  <strong>35</strong> And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.  <strong>36</strong> For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.  <strong>37</strong> After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.  <strong>38</strong> Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.  <strong>39</strong> And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.  <strong>40</strong> And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:  <strong>41</strong> The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;  <strong>42</strong> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even  two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;  <strong>43</strong> And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;  <strong>44</strong> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;  <strong>45</strong> And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of  bright brass.  <strong>46</strong> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.  <strong>47</strong> And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.  <strong>48</strong> And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,  <strong>49</strong> And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side,  and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,  <strong>50</strong> And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both  for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and  for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.  <strong>51</strong> So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns-forty-five beams, fifteen to a row. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and trimmed with a saw on their inner and outer faces. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits and some eight. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the LORD with its portico. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was a man of Tyre and a craftsman in bronze. Huram was highly skilled and experienced in all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits around, by line. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> A network of interwoven chains festooned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits high. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Below the rim, gourds encircled it-ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim-and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> He also made the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD: <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars); <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> the ten stands with their ten basins; <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> the Sea and the twelve bulls under it; <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of burnished bronze. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the LORD's temple: the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence; <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs; <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated-the silver and gold and the furnishings-and he placed them in the treasuries of the LORD's temple.
