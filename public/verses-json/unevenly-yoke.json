And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.  <strong>12</strong> Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the prophet,  after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>13</strong> Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.  <strong>14</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.  <strong>15</strong> Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.  <strong>1</strong> Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;  <strong>2</strong> (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)  <strong>3</strong> By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,  <strong>4</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;  <strong>5</strong> Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;  <strong>6</strong> Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.  <strong>7</strong> And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.  <strong>8</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.  <strong>9</strong> For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.  <strong>11</strong> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.  <strong>12</strong> Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.  <strong>13</strong> And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.  <strong>14</strong> And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.  <strong>15</strong> Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;  <strong>16</strong> Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;  <strong>17</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.  <strong>18</strong> And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:  <strong>19</strong> Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.  <strong>20</strong> Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:  <strong>21</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;  <strong>22</strong> And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;  <strong>23</strong> Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.  <strong>24</strong>           Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,  <strong>25</strong> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  <strong>26</strong> The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is  mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.  <strong>27</strong> Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?  <strong>28</strong> For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them;  and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  <strong>29</strong> And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.  <strong>30</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>31</strong> Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:  <strong>32</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the LORD in the presence of the priests and all the people: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the LORD's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,' declares the LORD, 'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said, \"Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the LORD's house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the LORD only if his prediction comes true.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and he said before all the people, \"This is what the LORD says: 'In the same way will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.'\" At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Shortly after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Go and tell Hananiah, 'This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.'\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, \"Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.'\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> undefined "},{"_id":"616ccfbee9d39d04b3b5fd11","topicId":"616ccfbae9d39d04b3b5fd07","verse":"1 John 1:1","votes":7,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p62001001_05-11\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v62001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched--this we proclaim concerning the Word of life."},{"_id":"616ccfbee9d39d04b3b5fd10","topicId":"616ccfbae9d39d04b3b5fd07","verse":"John 3:16-18","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43003016_07-12\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43003016-1\">16&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43003017-1\">17&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43003018-1\">18&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</span></p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
