“Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v48004031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;  <strong>2</strong> But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.  <strong>3</strong> Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:  <strong>4</strong> But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,  <strong>5</strong> To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.  <strong>6</strong> And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.  <strong>8</strong> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.  <strong>9</strong> But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?  <strong>10</strong> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.  <strong>11</strong> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.  <strong>12</strong> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.  <strong>13</strong> Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.  <strong>14</strong> And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.  <strong>15</strong> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.  <strong>16</strong> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?  <strong>17</strong> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.  <strong>18</strong> But it is good to be zealously affected always in a  good thing, and not only when I am present with you.  <strong>19</strong> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,  <strong>20</strong> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.  <strong>21</strong> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?  <strong>22</strong> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.  <strong>23</strong> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.  <strong>24</strong> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.  <strong>25</strong> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.  <strong>26</strong> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.  <strong>27</strong> For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.  <strong>28</strong> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.  <strong>29</strong> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.  <strong>30</strong> Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.  <strong>31</strong> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you! <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For it is written: \"Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But what does the Scripture say? \"Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.

And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans will not succeed or help him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back upon him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses-but only for a time. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Those who eat from the king's provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his fathers he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Nubians in submission. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
