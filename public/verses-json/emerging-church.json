But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.  <strong>7</strong> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  <strong>8</strong> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.  <strong>9</strong> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own  conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even  unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.  <strong>10</strong> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?  <strong>11</strong> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. <strong>12</strong> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.  <strong>13</strong> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.  <strong>14</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.  <strong>15</strong> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.  <strong>16</strong> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.  <strong>17</strong> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.  <strong>18</strong> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.  <strong>19</strong> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.  <strong>20</strong> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>22</strong> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>23</strong> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.  <strong>24</strong> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.  <strong>25</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.  <strong>26</strong> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.  <strong>27</strong> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.  <strong>28</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.  <strong>29</strong> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.  <strong>30</strong> As he spake these words, many believed on him.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;  <strong>32</strong> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  <strong>33</strong> They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.  <strong>35</strong> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but  the Son abideth ever.  <strong>36</strong> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.  <strong>37</strong> I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.  <strong>38</strong> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.  <strong>39</strong> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.  <strong>40</strong> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.  <strong>41</strong> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.  <strong>42</strong> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.  <strong>43</strong> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.  <strong>44</strong> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your  father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.  <strong>45</strong> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.  <strong>46</strong> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?  <strong>47</strong> He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them  not, because ye are not of God.  <strong>48</strong> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  <strong>49</strong> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.  <strong>50</strong> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.  <strong>51</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.  <strong>52</strong> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.  <strong>53</strong> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  <strong>54</strong> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:  <strong>55</strong> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.  <strong>56</strong> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it,  and was glad.  <strong>57</strong> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  <strong>58</strong> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.  <strong>59</strong> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and said to Jesus, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \"If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus straightened up and asked her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"No one, sir,\" she said. \"Then neither do I condemn you,\" Jesus declared. \"Go now and leave your life of sin.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The Pharisees challenged him, \"Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"Where is your father?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You do not know me or my Father,\" Jesus replied. \"If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\" He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Once more Jesus said to them, \"I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> This made the Jews ask, \"Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But he continued, \"You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Who are you?\" they asked. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Just what I have been claiming all along,\" Jesus replied. \"I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So Jesus said, \"When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They answered him, \"We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father. \" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Abraham is our father,\" they answered. \"If you were Abraham's children,\" said Jesus, \"then you would <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> do the things Abraham did. As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> You are doing the things your own father does.We are not illegitimate children,\" they protested. \"The only Father we have is God himself.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The Jews answered him, \"Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"I am not possessed by a demon,\" said Jesus, \"but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> At this the Jews exclaimed, \"Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> \"You are not yet fifty years old,\" the Jews said to him, \"and you have seen Abraham!\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"before Abraham was born, I am!\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The angel said to me, \"These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But he said to me, \"Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then he told me, \"Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be holy.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The Spirit and the bride say, \"Come!\" And let him who hears say, \"Come!\" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He who testifies to these things says, \"Yes, I am coming soon.\" Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen. "}]}
