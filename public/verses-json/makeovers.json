","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate. \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The chief priests accused him of many things. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So again Pilate asked him, \"Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?\" Pilate asked them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Crucify him!\" they shouted. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And they began to call out to him, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It was the third hour when they crucified him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \"So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> come down from the cross and save yourself!\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\" Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When some of those standing near heard this, they said, \"Listen, he's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,\" he said. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, \"Surely this man was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

A certain  man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it,  and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.  <strong>2</strong> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.  <strong>3</strong> And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.  <strong>4</strong> And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him  away shamefully handled.  <strong>5</strong> And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.  <strong>6</strong> Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.  <strong>7</strong> But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.  <strong>8</strong> And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.  <strong>9</strong> What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.  <strong>10</strong> And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:  <strong>11</strong> This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  <strong>12</strong> And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.  <strong>13</strong> And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.  <strong>14</strong> And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?  <strong>15</strong> Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may seeit.  <strong>16</strong> And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.  <strong>18</strong> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  <strong>19</strong> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  <strong>20</strong> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  <strong>21</strong> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.  <strong>22</strong> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  <strong>23</strong> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  <strong>24</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  <strong>25</strong> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.  <strong>26</strong> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am  the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  <strong>27</strong> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. <strong>28</strong> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:  <strong>30</strong> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  <strong>31</strong> And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.  <strong>32</strong> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  <strong>33</strong> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  <strong>34</strong> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?  <strong>36</strong> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  <strong>37</strong> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,  <strong>39</strong> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:  <strong>40</strong> Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. <strong>41</strong> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.  <strong>42</strong> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.  <strong>43</strong> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:  <strong>44</strong> For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> He then began to speak to them in parables: \"A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Haven't you read this scripture: \"'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They came to him and said, \"Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Should we pay or shouldn't we?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. \"Why are you trying to trap me?\" he asked. \"Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\" They brought the coin, and he asked them, \"Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?Caesar's,\" they replied. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\" And they were amazed at him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, \"How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\" The large crowd listened to him with delight. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> As he taught, Jesus said, \"Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \"I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on.\" "}]}
