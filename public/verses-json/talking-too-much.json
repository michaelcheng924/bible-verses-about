understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.  <strong>15</strong> All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.  <strong>16</strong> Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.  <strong>17</strong> Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.  <strong>18</strong> A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.  <strong>19</strong> The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.  <strong>20</strong> A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.  <strong>21</strong> Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.  <strong>22</strong> Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.  <strong>23</strong> A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken  in due season, how good is it!  <strong>24</strong> The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.  <strong>25</strong> The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.  <strong>26</strong> The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.  <strong>27</strong> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.  <strong>28</strong> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.  <strong>29</strong> The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.  <strong>30</strong> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.  <strong>31</strong> The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.  <strong>32</strong> He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.  <strong>33</strong> The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.
