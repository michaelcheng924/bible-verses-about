The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  <strong>16</strong> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  <strong>17</strong> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  <strong>18</strong> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  <strong>19</strong> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  <strong>20</strong> But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  <strong>21</strong> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  <strong>22</strong> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <strong>6</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <strong>7</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.  <strong>8</strong> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.  <strong>10</strong> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.  <strong>11</strong> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:  <strong>12</strong> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.  <strong>13</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art  thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.  <strong>14</strong> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?  <strong>15</strong> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and  fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.  <strong>16</strong> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.  <strong>17</strong> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  <strong>18</strong> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of  the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  <strong>19</strong> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <strong>20</strong> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <strong>21</strong> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.  <strong>22</strong> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  <strong>23</strong> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.  <strong>24</strong> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  <strong>25</strong> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  <strong>26</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <strong>27</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Where have you come from?\" David asked him. He answered, \"I have escaped from the Israelite camp.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"What happened?\" David asked. \"Tell me.\" He said, \"The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, \"How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,\" the young man said, \"and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, 'What can I do?' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"He asked me, 'Who are you?'\"'An Amalekite,' I answered. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then he said to me, 'Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> David said to the young man who brought him the report, \"Where are you from?I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite,\" he answered. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David asked him, \"Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then David called one of his men and said, \"Go, strike him down!\" So he struck him down, and he died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For David had said to him, \"Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me.

He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. \"He will rule them with an iron scepter.\" He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, \"Come, gather together for the great supper of God, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and mighty men, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, small and great.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The rest of them were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
