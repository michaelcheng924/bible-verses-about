You cannot serve both God and Money. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
