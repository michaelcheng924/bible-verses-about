and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.  <strong>9</strong> And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.  <strong>10</strong> All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?  <strong>11</strong> False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things  that I knew not.  <strong>12</strong> They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.  <strong>13</strong> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.  <strong>14</strong> I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or  brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his  mother.  <strong>15</strong> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:  <strong>16</strong> With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.  <strong>17</strong> Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.  <strong>18</strong> I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.  <strong>19</strong> Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.  <strong>20</strong> For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.  <strong>21</strong> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it. <strong>22</strong>             This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.  <strong>23</strong> Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.  <strong>24</strong> Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.  <strong>25</strong> Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.  <strong>26</strong> Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.  <strong>27</strong> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.  <strong>28</strong> And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.  <strong>1</strong> The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.  <strong>2</strong> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.  <strong>3</strong> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.  <strong>4</strong> He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.  <strong>5</strong> Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.  <strong>6</strong> Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.  <strong>7</strong> How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.  <strong>8</strong> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;

trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.  <strong>6</strong> And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.  <strong>7</strong> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.  <strong>8</strong> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.  <strong>9</strong> For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.  <strong>10</strong> For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be:  yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall  not be. <strong>11</strong> But the meek shall inherit the earth;

into smoke shall they consume away.  <strong>21</strong> The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.  <strong>22</strong> For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.  <strong>23</strong> The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.  <strong>24</strong> Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.  <strong>25</strong> I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.  <strong>26</strong>             He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is  blessed.  <strong>27</strong> Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.  <strong>28</strong> For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.  <strong>29</strong> The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.  <strong>30</strong> The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.  <strong>31</strong> The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.  <strong>32</strong> The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.  <strong>33</strong> The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.  <strong>34</strong> Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it. <strong>35</strong> I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.  <strong>36</strong> Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.  <strong>37</strong> Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.  <strong>38</strong> But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.  <strong>39</strong> But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is  their strength in the time of trouble.  <strong>40</strong> And the LORD shall help them and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.

Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> so that no one may boast before him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore, as it is written: \"Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.\" "},{"_id":"61678ceca3a86b670bc2f76c","topicId":"61678ce5a3a86b670bc2f755","verse":"John 11:1-57","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43011001_05-25\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v43011001-1\">11:1&nbsp;</b>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43011002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43011003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43011004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>But when Jesus heard it he said, <span class=\"woc\">“This illness does not lead to death.

If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  <strong>10</strong> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.  <strong>11</strong> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  <strong>12</strong> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  <strong>13</strong> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.  <strong>14</strong> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  <strong>15</strong> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  <strong>16</strong> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.  <strong>17</strong> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.  <strong>18</strong> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:  <strong>19</strong> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  <strong>20</strong> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <strong>22</strong> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  <strong>24</strong> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  <strong>25</strong> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:  <strong>26</strong> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Take away the stone,\" he said. \"But, Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"What are we accomplishing?\" they asked. \"Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.
