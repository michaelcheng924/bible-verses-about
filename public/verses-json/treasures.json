Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>3</strong> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  <strong>4</strong> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <strong>5</strong>           And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  <strong>7</strong> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  <strong>8</strong> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  <strong>9</strong> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  <strong>10</strong> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is  in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> Give us this day our daily bread.  <strong>12</strong> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  <strong>13</strong> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  <strong>14</strong> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:  <strong>15</strong> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <strong>16</strong>           Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>17</strong> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  <strong>18</strong> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  <strong>19</strong>           Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  <strong>20</strong> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:  <strong>21</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>22</strong> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  <strong>23</strong> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is  that darkness! <strong>24</strong>           No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  <strong>26</strong> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.

If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.

You cannot serve both God and Money. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
