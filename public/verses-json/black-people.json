And Jeremiah did so.  <strong>13</strong> So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.  <strong>14</strong> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.  <strong>15</strong> Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?  <strong>16</strong> So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As  the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.  <strong>17</strong> Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:  <strong>18</strong> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.  <strong>19</strong> And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.  <strong>20</strong> But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.  <strong>21</strong> But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me:  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.  <strong>23</strong> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.  <strong>24</strong> Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.  <strong>25</strong> But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:  <strong>26</strong> Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.  <strong>27</strong> Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.  <strong>28</strong> So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.  <strong>1</strong> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.  <strong>2</strong> And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.  <strong>3</strong> And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.  <strong>4</strong> And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.  <strong>5</strong> But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.  <strong>6</strong> Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.  <strong>7</strong> Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.  <strong>8</strong> And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.  <strong>9</strong> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.  <strong>10</strong> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.  <strong>11</strong> Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,  <strong>12</strong> Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.  <strong>13</strong> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;  <strong>14</strong> Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.  <strong>15</strong> Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,  <strong>16</strong> Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.  <strong>17</strong> But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.  <strong>18</strong> For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people when he said, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD says: 'Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague, but whoever goes over to the Babylonians will live. He will escape with his life; he will live.' <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And this is what the LORD says: 'This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.'\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then the officials said to the king, \"This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"He is in your hands,\" King Zedekiah answered. \"The king can do nothing to oppose you.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king's son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But Ebed-Melech, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Ebed-Melech went out of the palace and said to him, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite, \"Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, \"Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.\" Jeremiah did so, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. \"I am going to ask you something,\" the king said to Jeremiah. \"Do not hide anything from me.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, \"If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: \"As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who are seeking your life.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, \"This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: 'If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be handed over to the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from their hands.'\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, \"I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"They will not hand you over,\" Jeremiah replied. \"Obey the LORD by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me: <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: \"'They misled you and overcame you- those trusted friends of yours. Your feet are sunk in the mud; your friends have deserted you.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, \"Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> then tell them, 'I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan's house to die there.'\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> All the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> undefined "},{"_id":"6159aa037c790f6c0a491067","topicId":"6159aa007c790f6c0a49105d","verse":"Song of Solomon 5:11","votes":8,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p22005011_01-10\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v22005011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;His head is the finest gold;</span><br><span id=\"p22005011_01-10\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his locks are wavy,</span><br><span id=\"p22005011_01-10\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;black as a raven.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>11</strong> His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are  bushy, and black as a raven.

Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So there was great joy in that city. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, \"This man is the divine power known as the Great Power.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and said, \"Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter answered: \"May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Simon answered, \"Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \"Go south to the road--the desert road--that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The Spirit told Philip, \"Go to that chariot and stay near it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: \"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \"Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
