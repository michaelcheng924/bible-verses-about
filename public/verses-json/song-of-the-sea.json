Your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you.

I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Who among the gods is like you, O LORD? Who is like you- majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> You stretched out your right hand and the earth swallowed them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed.

By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone- until your people pass by, O LORD, until the people you bought pass by. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance- the place, O LORD, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, your hands established. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The LORD will reign for ever and ever.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Pharaoh's horses, chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her, with tambourines and dancing. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Miriam sang to them: \"Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah. ) <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, \"What are we to drink?\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the LORD made a decree and a law for them, and there he tested them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He said, \"If you listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.

And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <strong>4</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.

O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  <strong>26</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <strong>27</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

And it was so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God called the expanse \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day.

Selah <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Our God is a God who saves; from the Sovereign LORD comes escape from death. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The Lord says, \"I will bring them from Bashan; I will bring them from the depths of the sea, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> that you may plunge your feet in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Your procession has come into view, O God, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the maidens playing tambourines. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Praise God in the great congregation; praise the LORD in the assembly of Israel. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> There is the little tribe of Benjamin, leading them, there the great throng of Judah's princes, and there the princes of Zebulun and of Naphtali. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Summon your power, O God; show us your strength, O God, as you have done before. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Envoys will come from Egypt; Cush will submit herself to God. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord, Selah <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> to him who rides the ancient skies above, who thunders with mighty voice. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the skies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> You are awesome, O God, in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.

Gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He chose the best land for himself; the leader's portion was kept for him. When the heads of the people assembled, he carried out the LORD's righteous will, and his judgments concerning Israel.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> About Dan he said: \"Dan is a lion's cub, springing out of Bashan.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> About Naphtali he said: \"Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the LORD and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> About Asher he said: \"Most blessed of sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will equal your days. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He will drive out your enemy before you, saying, 'Destroy him!' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So Israel will live in safety alone; Jacob's spring is secure in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens drop dew. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Blessed are you, O Israel!

 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.

and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.  <strong>39</strong> And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.  <strong>40</strong> They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.  <strong>41</strong> And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.  <strong>42</strong> So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.  <strong>43</strong> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.  <strong>44</strong> Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.  <strong>45</strong> Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.  <strong>46</strong> And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.  <strong>47</strong> Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing,  thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.  <strong>48</strong> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.  <strong>49</strong> Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  <strong>50</strong> And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.  <strong>51</strong> Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.  <strong>52</strong> Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.  <strong>53</strong> When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:  <strong>54</strong> That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.  <strong>55</strong> When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.  <strong>56</strong> For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,  <strong>57</strong> Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy  reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.  <strong>58</strong> Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.  <strong>59</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.  <strong>60</strong> Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.  <strong>61</strong> Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.  <strong>62</strong> And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:  <strong>63</strong> That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"'Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, \"Live!\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, you who were naked and bare. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became mine. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was fine flour, honey and olive oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"'But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. Such things should not happen, nor should they ever occur. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Also the food I provided for you-the fine flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat-you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"'Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all your other wickedness, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At the head of every street you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, offering your body with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and provoked me to anger with your increasing promiscuity. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"'How weak-willed you are, declares the Sovereign LORD, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When you built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"'You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Every prostitute receives a fee, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"'Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD! <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your wealth and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children's blood, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see all your nakedness. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring upon you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then I will hand you over to your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you naked and bare. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"'Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices? <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"'Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: \"Like mother, like daughter.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> You not only walked in their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> \"'However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them, <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines-all those around you who despise you. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the LORD. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> \"'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign LORD.'\" "},{"_id":"616ade8f9dfb4d9c011d8fdf","topicId":"616ade889dfb4d9c011d8fcb","verse":"Jeremiah 2:2","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p24002002_01-19\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v24002002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>“Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD,</p>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p24002002_01-19\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;“I remember the devotion of your youth,</span><br><span id=\"p24002002_01-19\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your love as a bride,</span><br><span id=\"p24002002_01-19\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;how you followed me in the wilderness,</span><br><span id=\"p24002002_01-19\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a land not sown.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>2</strong> Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.

 <strong>2</strong> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;  <strong>3</strong> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;  <strong>4</strong> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.  <strong>5</strong> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:  <strong>6</strong> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.  <strong>7</strong> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but  fools despise wisdom and instruction.  <strong>8</strong> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:  <strong>9</strong> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.  <strong>10</strong> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.  <strong>11</strong> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:  <strong>12</strong> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:  <strong>13</strong> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:  <strong>14</strong> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:  <strong>15</strong> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:  <strong>16</strong> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.  <strong>17</strong> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.  <strong>18</strong> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.  <strong>19</strong> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.  <strong>20</strong> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:  <strong>21</strong> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,  <strong>22</strong> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?  <strong>23</strong> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.  <strong>24</strong> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;  <strong>25</strong> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:  <strong>26</strong> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;  <strong>27</strong> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.  <strong>28</strong> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:  <strong>29</strong> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:  <strong>30</strong> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.  <strong>31</strong> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.  <strong>32</strong> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.  <strong>33</strong> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.  <strong>1</strong> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;  <strong>2</strong> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;  <strong>3</strong> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;  <strong>4</strong> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for  hid treasures;  <strong>5</strong> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.  <strong>6</strong> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.  <strong>7</strong> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.  <strong>8</strong> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.  <strong>9</strong> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.  <strong>10</strong> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;  <strong>11</strong> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:  <strong>12</strong> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;  <strong>13</strong> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;  <strong>14</strong> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;  <strong>15</strong> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:  <strong>16</strong> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;  <strong>17</strong> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.  <strong>18</strong> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.  <strong>19</strong> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.  <strong>20</strong> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.  <strong>21</strong> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.  <strong>22</strong> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.  <strong>1</strong> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:  <strong>2</strong> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.  <strong>3</strong> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:  <strong>4</strong> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.  <strong>5</strong> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  <strong>6</strong> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  <strong>7</strong> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.  <strong>8</strong> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.  <strong>9</strong> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:  <strong>10</strong> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.  <strong>11</strong> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:  <strong>12</strong> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.  <strong>13</strong> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.  <strong>14</strong> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.  <strong>15</strong> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.  <strong>16</strong> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.  <strong>17</strong> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.  <strong>18</strong> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.  <strong>19</strong> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.  <strong>20</strong> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.  <strong>21</strong> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:  <strong>22</strong> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.  <strong>23</strong> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.  <strong>24</strong> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.  <strong>25</strong> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.  <strong>26</strong> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.  <strong>27</strong> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.  <strong>28</strong> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.  <strong>29</strong> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.  <strong>30</strong> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.  <strong>31</strong> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.  <strong>32</strong> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.  <strong>33</strong> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.  <strong>34</strong> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.  <strong>35</strong> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.  <strong>1</strong> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.  <strong>2</strong> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.  <strong>3</strong> For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.  <strong>4</strong> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.  <strong>5</strong> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.  <strong>6</strong> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.  <strong>7</strong> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.  <strong>8</strong> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.  <strong>9</strong> She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.  <strong>10</strong> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.  <strong>11</strong> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.  <strong>12</strong> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.  <strong>13</strong> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.  <strong>14</strong> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.  <strong>15</strong> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.  <strong>16</strong> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.  <strong>17</strong> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.  <strong>18</strong> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.  <strong>19</strong> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.  <strong>20</strong> My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.  <strong>21</strong> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.  <strong>22</strong> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.  <strong>23</strong> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.  <strong>24</strong> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.  <strong>25</strong> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.  <strong>26</strong> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.  <strong>27</strong> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.  <strong>1</strong> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:  <strong>2</strong> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.  <strong>3</strong> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:  <strong>4</strong> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.  <strong>5</strong> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.  <strong>6</strong> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.  <strong>7</strong> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.  <strong>8</strong> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:  <strong>9</strong> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:  <strong>10</strong> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be  in the house of a stranger;  <strong>11</strong> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,  <strong>12</strong> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;  <strong>13</strong> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!  <strong>14</strong> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.  <strong>15</strong> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.  <strong>16</strong> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.  <strong>17</strong> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.  <strong>18</strong> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.  <strong>19</strong> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.  <strong>20</strong> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?  <strong>21</strong> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.  <strong>22</strong> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.  <strong>23</strong> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.  <strong>1</strong> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,  <strong>2</strong> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.  <strong>3</strong> Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.  <strong>4</strong> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.  <strong>5</strong> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.  <strong>6</strong> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:  <strong>7</strong> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  <strong>8</strong> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.  <strong>9</strong> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?  <strong>10</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>11</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.  <strong>12</strong> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.  <strong>13</strong> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;  <strong>14</strong> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.  <strong>16</strong> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are  an abomination unto him:  <strong>17</strong> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,  <strong>18</strong> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,  <strong>19</strong> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.  <strong>20</strong> My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:  <strong>21</strong> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.  <strong>22</strong> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.  <strong>23</strong> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:  <strong>24</strong> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  <strong>25</strong> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.  <strong>26</strong> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.  <strong>27</strong> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?  <strong>28</strong> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  <strong>29</strong> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.  <strong>30</strong> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;  <strong>31</strong> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.  <strong>32</strong> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.  <strong>33</strong> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.  <strong>34</strong> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  <strong>35</strong> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.  <strong>1</strong> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.  <strong>2</strong> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.  <strong>3</strong> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.  <strong>4</strong> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:  <strong>5</strong> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.  <strong>6</strong> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,  <strong>7</strong> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,  <strong>8</strong> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,  <strong>9</strong> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:  <strong>10</strong> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.  <strong>11</strong> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:  <strong>12</strong> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)  <strong>13</strong> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,  <strong>14</strong> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  <strong>16</strong> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,  with fine linen of Egypt.  <strong>17</strong> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  <strong>18</strong> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.  <strong>19</strong> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:  <strong>20</strong> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.  <strong>21</strong> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.  <strong>22</strong> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;  <strong>23</strong> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.  <strong>24</strong> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.  <strong>25</strong> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.  <strong>26</strong> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men  have been slain by her.  <strong>27</strong> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.  <strong>1</strong> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  <strong>2</strong> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  <strong>3</strong> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  <strong>4</strong> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.  <strong>5</strong> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  <strong>6</strong> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.  <strong>7</strong> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  <strong>8</strong> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is  nothing froward or perverse in them.  <strong>9</strong> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  <strong>10</strong> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  <strong>11</strong> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  <strong>12</strong> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  <strong>13</strong> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  <strong>14</strong> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.  <strong>15</strong> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  <strong>16</strong> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.  <strong>17</strong> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.  <strong>18</strong> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  <strong>19</strong> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.  <strong>20</strong> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:  <strong>21</strong> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  <strong>22</strong> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  <strong>23</strong> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  <strong>24</strong> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.  <strong>25</strong> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:  <strong>26</strong> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  <strong>27</strong> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  <strong>28</strong> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:  <strong>29</strong> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:  <strong>30</strong> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:  and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;  <strong>31</strong> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.  <strong>32</strong> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.  <strong>33</strong> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.  <strong>34</strong> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.  <strong>35</strong> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.  <strong>36</strong> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.  <strong>1</strong> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:  <strong>2</strong> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.  <strong>3</strong> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,  <strong>4</strong> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  <strong>5</strong> Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.  <strong>6</strong> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.  <strong>7</strong> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.  <strong>8</strong> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.  <strong>9</strong> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.  <strong>10</strong> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.  <strong>11</strong> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.  <strong>12</strong> If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. <strong>13</strong> A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.  <strong>14</strong> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,  <strong>15</strong> To call passengers who go right on their ways:  <strong>16</strong> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  <strong>17</strong> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.  <strong>18</strong> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that  her guests are in the depths of hell.

Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each will turn from his wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD's temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD's temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> he went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, \"Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.\" So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> They said to him, \"Sit down, please, and read it to us.\" So Baruch read it to them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, \"We must report all these words to the king.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then they asked Baruch, \"Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" Baruch replied, \"he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then the officials said to Baruch, \"You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe's knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, \"Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and animals from it?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire.

Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?

And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.  <strong>3</strong> And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.  <strong>4</strong> And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.  <strong>5</strong> Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.  <strong>6</strong> Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!  <strong>7</strong> And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father’s sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.  <strong>8</strong> And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am? <strong>9</strong> Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.  <strong>10</strong> Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master’s son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master’s son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.  <strong>11</strong> Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king’s sons.  <strong>12</strong> And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.  <strong>13</strong> So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king’s table; and was lame on both his feet.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.  <strong>2</strong> Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.  <strong>3</strong> And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?  <strong>4</strong> Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.  <strong>5</strong> When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.  <strong>6</strong> And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men.  <strong>7</strong> And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.  <strong>8</strong> And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ish-tob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.  <strong>9</strong> When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:  <strong>10</strong> And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.  <strong>11</strong> And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.  <strong>12</strong> Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.  <strong>13</strong> And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.  <strong>14</strong> And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.  <strong>15</strong> And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.  <strong>16</strong> And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were  beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.  <strong>17</strong> And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.  <strong>18</strong> And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of  seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.  <strong>19</strong> And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.  <strong>2</strong> And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king’s house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.  <strong>3</strong> And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?  <strong>4</strong> And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.  <strong>5</strong> And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am  with child.  <strong>6</strong> And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.  <strong>7</strong> And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.  <strong>8</strong> And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.  <strong>9</strong> But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.  <strong>10</strong> And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?  <strong>11</strong> And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.  <strong>12</strong> And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.  <strong>13</strong> And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.  <strong>15</strong> And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.  <strong>17</strong> And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.  <strong>18</strong> Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;  <strong>19</strong> And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king,  <strong>20</strong> And if so be that the king’s wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?  <strong>21</strong> Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.  <strong>22</strong> So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.  <strong>23</strong> And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.  <strong>24</strong> And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king’s servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.  <strong>25</strong> Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.  <strong>26</strong> And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.  <strong>27</strong> And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.  <strong>2</strong> The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:  <strong>3</strong> But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.  <strong>4</strong> And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.  <strong>5</strong> And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die:  <strong>6</strong> And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.  <strong>7</strong> And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;  <strong>8</strong> And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.  <strong>9</strong> Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.  <strong>10</strong> Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.  <strong>11</strong> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.  <strong>12</strong> For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.  <strong>13</strong> And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.  <strong>14</strong> Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.  <strong>15</strong> And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.  <strong>16</strong> David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.  <strong>17</strong> And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.  <strong>18</strong> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?  <strong>19</strong> But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.  <strong>20</strong> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself,  and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.  <strong>21</strong> Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was  alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.  <strong>22</strong> And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?  <strong>23</strong> But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.  <strong>24</strong> And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.  <strong>25</strong> And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.  <strong>26</strong> And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.  <strong>27</strong> And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.  <strong>28</strong> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.  <strong>29</strong> And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.  <strong>30</strong> And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.  <strong>31</strong> And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.  <strong>2</strong> And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.  <strong>3</strong> But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.  <strong>4</strong> And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.  <strong>5</strong> And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.  <strong>6</strong> So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.  <strong>7</strong> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.  <strong>8</strong> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.  <strong>9</strong> And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.  <strong>10</strong> And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.  <strong>11</strong> And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.  <strong>12</strong> And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.  <strong>13</strong> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.  <strong>14</strong> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.  <strong>15</strong> Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.  <strong>16</strong> And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.  <strong>17</strong> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.  <strong>18</strong> And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.  <strong>19</strong> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.  <strong>20</strong> And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.  <strong>21</strong> But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.  <strong>22</strong> And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.  <strong>24</strong> And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.  <strong>25</strong> And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.  <strong>26</strong> Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?  <strong>27</strong> But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.  <strong>28</strong> Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous and be valiant.  <strong>29</strong> And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.  <strong>31</strong> Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.  <strong>32</strong> And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.  <strong>33</strong> Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.  <strong>34</strong> But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.  <strong>35</strong> And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.  <strong>37</strong> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.  <strong>38</strong> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.  <strong>39</strong> And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.  <strong>1</strong> Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was  toward Absalom.  <strong>2</strong> And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:  <strong>3</strong> And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.  <strong>4</strong> And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.  <strong>5</strong> And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.  <strong>6</strong> And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.  <strong>7</strong> And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.  <strong>8</strong> And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.  <strong>9</strong> And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.  <strong>10</strong> And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.  <strong>11</strong> Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.  <strong>12</strong> Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one  word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.  <strong>14</strong> For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any  person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.  <strong>15</strong> Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.  <strong>16</strong> For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.  <strong>17</strong> Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.  <strong>18</strong> Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.  <strong>19</strong> And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid:  <strong>20</strong> To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.  <strong>21</strong> And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.  <strong>22</strong> And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, Today thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.  <strong>23</strong> So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.  <strong>24</strong> And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s face.  <strong>25</strong> But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.  <strong>26</strong> And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s weight.  <strong>27</strong> And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.  <strong>28</strong> So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s face.  <strong>29</strong> Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.  <strong>31</strong> Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?  <strong>32</strong> And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.  <strong>33</strong> So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.  <strong>2</strong> And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art  thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.  <strong>3</strong> And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.  <strong>4</strong> Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!  <strong>5</strong> And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him  to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.  <strong>6</strong> And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.  <strong>8</strong> For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.  <strong>10</strong> But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.  <strong>11</strong> And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were  called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.  <strong>12</strong> And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.  <strong>14</strong> And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.  <strong>15</strong> And the king’s servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.  <strong>16</strong> And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.  <strong>17</strong> And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.  <strong>18</strong> And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.  <strong>19</strong> Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art  a stranger, and also an exile.  <strong>20</strong> Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.  <strong>21</strong> And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.  <strong>22</strong> And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.  <strong>23</strong> And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.  <strong>24</strong> And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.  <strong>25</strong> And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:  <strong>26</strong> But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am  I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.  <strong>27</strong> The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.  <strong>28</strong> See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.  <strong>29</strong> Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.  <strong>30</strong> And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.  <strong>31</strong> And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.  <strong>32</strong> And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:  <strong>33</strong> Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me:  <strong>34</strong> But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father’s servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.  <strong>35</strong> And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.  <strong>36</strong> Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.  <strong>37</strong> So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.  <strong>1</strong> And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.  <strong>2</strong> And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king’s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.  <strong>3</strong> And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.  <strong>4</strong> Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.  <strong>5</strong> And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.  <strong>6</strong> And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.  <strong>7</strong> And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:  <strong>8</strong> The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.  <strong>9</strong> Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.  <strong>10</strong> And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  <strong>11</strong> And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.  <strong>12</strong> It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.  <strong>13</strong> And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill’s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.  <strong>14</strong> And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.  <strong>15</strong> And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.  <strong>17</strong> And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?  <strong>18</strong> And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.  <strong>19</strong> And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve  in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.  <strong>20</strong> Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.  <strong>21</strong> And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.  <strong>22</strong> So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.  <strong>23</strong> And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was  all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.  <strong>1</strong> Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:  <strong>2</strong> And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only:  <strong>3</strong> And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.  <strong>4</strong> And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.  <strong>5</strong> Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.  <strong>6</strong> And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.  <strong>7</strong> And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.  <strong>8</strong> For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.  <strong>10</strong> And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.  <strong>12</strong> So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.  <strong>13</strong> Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.  <strong>14</strong> And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.  <strong>15</strong> Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.  <strong>16</strong> Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.  <strong>17</strong> Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.  <strong>18</strong> Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.  <strong>19</strong> And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.  <strong>20</strong> And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them,  they returned to Jerusalem.  <strong>21</strong> And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.  <strong>22</strong> Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.  <strong>23</strong> And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.  <strong>24</strong> Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.  <strong>25</strong> And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man’s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother.  <strong>26</strong> So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,  <strong>28</strong> Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse,  <strong>29</strong> And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.  <strong>1</strong> And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.  <strong>2</strong> And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.  <strong>3</strong> But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is  better that thou succour us out of the city.  <strong>4</strong> And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.  <strong>5</strong> And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal  gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.  <strong>6</strong> So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;  <strong>7</strong> Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.  <strong>8</strong> For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.  <strong>9</strong> And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.  <strong>10</strong> And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.  <strong>11</strong> And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.  <strong>12</strong> And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king’s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.  <strong>13</strong> Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.  <strong>14</strong> Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.  <strong>15</strong> And ten young men that bare Joab’s armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.  <strong>16</strong> And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.  <strong>17</strong> And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.  <strong>18</strong> Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king’s dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place.  <strong>19</strong> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.  <strong>20</strong> And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?  <strong>23</strong> But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.  <strong>24</strong> And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.  <strong>25</strong> And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.  <strong>26</strong> And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.  <strong>27</strong> And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is  a good man, and cometh with good tidings.  <strong>28</strong> And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be  the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.  <strong>29</strong> And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.  <strong>30</strong> And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.  <strong>31</strong> And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.  <strong>32</strong> And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is. <strong>33</strong> And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!  <strong>1</strong> And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.  <strong>2</strong> And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.  <strong>3</strong> And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.  <strong>4</strong> But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!  <strong>5</strong> And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;  <strong>6</strong> In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.  <strong>7</strong> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.  <strong>8</strong> Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.  <strong>9</strong> And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.  <strong>10</strong> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?  <strong>11</strong> And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even  to his house.  <strong>12</strong> Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?  <strong>13</strong> And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.  <strong>14</strong> And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.  <strong>15</strong> So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.  <strong>16</strong> And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.  <strong>17</strong> And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.  <strong>18</strong> And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;  <strong>19</strong> And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.  <strong>20</strong> For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.  <strong>21</strong> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?  <strong>22</strong> And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?  <strong>23</strong> Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.  <strong>24</strong> And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.  <strong>25</strong> And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?  <strong>26</strong> And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.  <strong>27</strong> And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.  <strong>28</strong> For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?  <strong>29</strong> And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.  <strong>30</strong> And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.  <strong>31</strong> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.  <strong>32</strong> Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.  <strong>33</strong> And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.  <strong>34</strong> And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?  <strong>35</strong> I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?  <strong>36</strong> Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?  <strong>37</strong> Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.  <strong>38</strong> And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.  <strong>39</strong> And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.  <strong>40</strong> Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.  <strong>41</strong> And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him, over Jordan?  <strong>42</strong> And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?  <strong>43</strong> And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.  <strong>1</strong> And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was  Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.  <strong>2</strong> So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.  <strong>3</strong> And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.  <strong>4</strong> Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.  <strong>5</strong> So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.  <strong>6</strong> And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.  <strong>7</strong> And there went out after him Joab’s men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.  <strong>8</strong> When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.  <strong>9</strong> And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.  <strong>10</strong> But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab’s hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.  <strong>11</strong> And one of Joab’s men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.  <strong>12</strong> And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.  <strong>13</strong> When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.  <strong>14</strong> And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Beth-maachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.  <strong>15</strong> And they came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.  <strong>16</strong> Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.  <strong>17</strong> And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.  <strong>18</strong> Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.  <strong>19</strong> I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?  <strong>20</strong> And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.  <strong>21</strong> The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even  against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.  <strong>22</strong> Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.  <strong>23</strong> Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:  <strong>24</strong> And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:  <strong>25</strong> And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were  the priests:  <strong>26</strong> And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> David asked, \"Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now there was a servant of Saul's household named Ziba.

Ziba answered, \"He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. David said, \"Mephibosheth!Your servant,\" he replied. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Don't be afraid,\" David said to him, \"for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Mephibosheth bowed down and said, \"What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, \"I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master's grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table.\" (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.) <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then Ziba said to the king, \"Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do.\" So Mephibosheth ate at David's table like one of the king's sons. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica, and all the members of Ziba's household were servants of Mephibosheth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table, and he was crippled in both feet. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> undefined "},{"_id":"616ade909dfb4d9c011d8fe3","topicId":"616ade889dfb4d9c011d8fcb","verse":"1 Kings 1:1-2:46","votes":2,"__v":0,"kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.  <strong>2</strong> Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.  <strong>3</strong> So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.  <strong>4</strong> And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.  <strong>5</strong> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.  <strong>6</strong> And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.  <strong>7</strong> And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.  <strong>8</strong> But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged  to David, were not with Adonijah.  <strong>9</strong> And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:  <strong>10</strong> But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.  <strong>11</strong> Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?  <strong>12</strong> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.  <strong>13</strong> Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?  <strong>14</strong> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.  <strong>15</strong> And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.  <strong>16</strong> And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?  <strong>17</strong> And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.  <strong>18</strong> And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:  <strong>19</strong> And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.  <strong>20</strong> And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.  <strong>21</strong> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.  <strong>22</strong> And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.  <strong>23</strong> And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.  <strong>24</strong> And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  <strong>25</strong> For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.  <strong>26</strong> But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.  <strong>27</strong> Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?  <strong>28</strong> Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.  <strong>29</strong> And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,  <strong>30</strong> Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.  <strong>31</strong> Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.  <strong>32</strong> And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.  <strong>33</strong> The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:  <strong>34</strong> And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.  <strong>35</strong> Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.  <strong>36</strong> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.  <strong>37</strong> As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.  <strong>38</strong> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.  <strong>39</strong> And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.  <strong>40</strong> And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.  <strong>41</strong> And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?  <strong>42</strong> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.  <strong>43</strong> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.  <strong>44</strong> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:  <strong>45</strong> And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.  <strong>46</strong> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.  <strong>47</strong> And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.  <strong>48</strong> And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.  <strong>49</strong> And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.  <strong>50</strong> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <strong>51</strong> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.  <strong>52</strong> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.  <strong>53</strong> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.  <strong>1</strong> Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying,  <strong>2</strong> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;  <strong>3</strong> And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:  <strong>4</strong> That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.  <strong>5</strong> Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.  <strong>6</strong> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.  <strong>7</strong> But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.  <strong>8</strong> And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.  <strong>9</strong> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.  <strong>10</strong> So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.  <strong>11</strong> And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.  <strong>12</strong> Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.  <strong>13</strong> And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.  <strong>14</strong> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.  <strong>15</strong> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that  all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.  <strong>18</strong> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.  <strong>19</strong> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.  <strong>20</strong> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,  say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  <strong>21</strong> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  <strong>22</strong> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  <strong>23</strong> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.  <strong>24</strong> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.  <strong>25</strong> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.  <strong>26</strong> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.  <strong>27</strong> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  <strong>28</strong> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <strong>29</strong> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.  <strong>30</strong> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.  <strong>31</strong> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.  <strong>32</strong> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.  <strong>33</strong> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.  <strong>34</strong> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  <strong>35</strong> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.  <strong>36</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.  <strong>37</strong> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.  <strong>38</strong> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.  <strong>39</strong> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.  <strong>40</strong> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  <strong>41</strong> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  <strong>42</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.  <strong>43</strong> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?  <strong>44</strong> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  <strong>45</strong> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.  <strong>46</strong> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When King David was old and well advanced in years, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So his servants said to him, \"Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him.
