And he arose and stood forth.  <strong>9</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?  <strong>10</strong> And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.  <strong>11</strong> And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.  <strong>12</strong> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.  <strong>13</strong> And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;  <strong>14</strong> Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,  <strong>15</strong> Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,  <strong>16</strong> And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.  <strong>17</strong> And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;  <strong>18</strong> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.  <strong>19</strong> And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.  <strong>20</strong> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.  <strong>21</strong> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  <strong>22</strong> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.  <strong>23</strong> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.  <strong>24</strong> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.  <strong>25</strong> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger.
