Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007031_14-3\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007035_14-3\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry—it is no sin. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</p>\n<p id=\"p46007038_14-3\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46007039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives.

But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.

 <strong>6</strong> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.  <strong>7</strong> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.  <strong>8</strong> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.  <strong>9</strong> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.  <strong>10</strong> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.  <strong>11</strong> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.  <strong>12</strong> And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.  <strong>13</strong> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:  <strong>14</strong> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that  thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.  <strong>16</strong> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.  <strong>17</strong> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.  <strong>18</strong> And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.  <strong>19</strong> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.  <strong>20</strong> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.  <strong>21</strong> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.  <strong>22</strong> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;  <strong>23</strong> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?  <strong>24</strong> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.  <strong>25</strong> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.  <strong>26</strong> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being  in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.  <strong>28</strong> And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these things.  <strong>29</strong> And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.  <strong>31</strong> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.  <strong>32</strong> And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that were with him.  <strong>33</strong> And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.  <strong>35</strong> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.  <strong>36</strong> And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.  <strong>37</strong> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:  <strong>38</strong> But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.  <strong>39</strong> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.  <strong>40</strong> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:  <strong>41</strong> Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.  <strong>42</strong> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;  <strong>43</strong> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;  <strong>44</strong> And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.  <strong>45</strong> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.  <strong>46</strong> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,  and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.  <strong>47</strong> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.  <strong>48</strong> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.  <strong>49</strong> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.  <strong>50</strong> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.  <strong>52</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.  <strong>53</strong> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.  <strong>54</strong> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.  <strong>55</strong> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.  <strong>56</strong> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.  <strong>57</strong> And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  <strong>58</strong> And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.  <strong>59</strong> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.  <strong>60</strong> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.  <strong>61</strong> And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.  <strong>62</strong> And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.  <strong>63</strong> And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.  <strong>64</strong> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.  <strong>65</strong> For she had said unto the servant, What man is  this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had  said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.  <strong>66</strong> And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.  <strong>67</strong> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He said to the chief servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, \"Put your hand under my thigh. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The servant asked him, \"What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Make sure that you do not take my son back there,\" Abraham said. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land'-he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then he prayed, \"O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> May it be that when I say to a girl, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too'-let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The servant hurried to meet her and said, \"Please give me a little water from your jar.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Drink, my lord,\" she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After she had given him a drink, she said, \"I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he asked, \"Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She answered him, \"I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And she added, \"We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> saying, \"Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The girl ran and told her mother's household about these things. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,\" he said. \"Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then food was set before him, but he said, \"I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.Then tell us,\" Laban said. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So he said, \"I am Abraham's servant. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, and camels and donkeys. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> My master's wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> And my master made me swear an oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?' <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then, when you go to my clan, you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you-you will be released from my oath.' <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"When I came to the spring today, I said, 'O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> See, I am standing beside this spring; if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, \"Please let me drink a little water from your jar,\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> and if she says to me, \"Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too,\" let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master's son.' <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.' <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?'\"She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.'\"Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Laban and Bethuel answered, \"This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, \"Send me on my way to my master.\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> But her brother and her mother replied, \"Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; then you may go.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then they said, \"Let's call the girl and ask her about it.\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> So they called Rebekah and asked her, \"Will you go with this man?I will go,\" she said. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, \"Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> and asked the servant, \"Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?He is my master,\" the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> Then the servant told Isaac all he had done. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
