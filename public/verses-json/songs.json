He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.

And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  <strong>24</strong> And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.  <strong>25</strong> And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.  <strong>26</strong> But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.  <strong>27</strong> And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.  <strong>28</strong> And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.  <strong>29</strong> Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?  <strong>30</strong> And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,  <strong>31</strong> And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.  <strong>32</strong> Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.  <strong>33</strong> Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  <strong>34</strong> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  <strong>35</strong> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  <strong>36</strong> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  <strong>37</strong> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <strong>38</strong> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  <strong>39</strong> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  <strong>40</strong> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  <strong>41</strong> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  <strong>42</strong> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  <strong>43</strong> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  <strong>44</strong> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  <strong>45</strong> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>46</strong> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  <strong>47</strong> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  <strong>48</strong> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, \"Cornelius!\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Cornelius stared at him in fear. \"What is it, Lord?\" he asked. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then a voice told him, \"Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Surely not, Lord!\" Peter replied. \"I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The voice spoke to him a second time, \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, \"Simon, three men are looking for you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Peter went down and said to the men, \"I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men replied, \"We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Peter made him get up. \"Stand up,\" he said, \"I am only a man myself.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to them: \"You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cornelius answered: \"Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
