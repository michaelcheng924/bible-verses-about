while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?  <strong>11</strong> Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, O God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, \"Where is your God?\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> These things I remember as I pour out my soul: how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> my God. My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon-from Mount Mizar. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me- a prayer to the God of my life. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I say to God my Rock, \"Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, \"Where is your God?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
