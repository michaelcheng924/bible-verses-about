I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of  Baal.  <strong>5</strong> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <strong>6</strong> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.  <strong>7</strong> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded  <strong>8</strong> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  <strong>10</strong> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  <strong>11</strong> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  <strong>12</strong> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?  <strong>13</strong> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  <strong>14</strong> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them.  <strong>15</strong> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  <strong>16</strong> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  <strong>17</strong> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  <strong>18</strong> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.  <strong>20</strong> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  <strong>21</strong> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.  <strong>22</strong> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  <strong>23</strong> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  <strong>24</strong> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?  <strong>25</strong> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  <strong>26</strong> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  <strong>27</strong> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  <strong>28</strong> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.  <strong>29</strong> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.  <strong>30</strong> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  <strong>31</strong> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  <strong>32</strong> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  <strong>33</strong> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  <strong>34</strong> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  <strong>35</strong> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  <strong>36</strong> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.

Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You will say then, \"Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \"The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
