And they were gathered at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side, with a valley between them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail, and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of bronze. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And he had bronze armor on his legs, and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And his shield-bearer went before him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>He stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day. Give me a man, that we may fight together.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"p09017011_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>Now David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. In the days of Saul the man was already old and advanced in years. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening.</p>\n<p id=\"p09017016_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>And Jesse said to David his son, “Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand.

And he came to the encampment as the host was going out to the battle line, shouting the war cry. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>And David left the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the ranks and went and greeted his brothers. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines and spoke the same words as before.

Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And the king will enrich the man who kills him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father’s house free in Israel.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>And David said to the men who stood by him, “What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And the people answered him in the same way, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.”</p>\n<p id=\"p09017027_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Now Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. And Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? And with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And David said, “What have I done now? Was it not but a word?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>And he turned away from him toward another, and spoke in the same way, and the people answered him again as before.</p>\n<p id=\"p09017030_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>When the words that David spoke were heard, they repeated them before Saul, and he sent for him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father. And when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb from the flock, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>I went after him and struck him and delivered it out of his mouth. And if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and struck him and killed him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>And David said, “The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and the LORD be with you!”</p>\n<p id=\"p09017037_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>Then Saul clothed David with his armor. He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>and David strapped his sword over his armor. And he tried in vain to go, for he had not tested them. Then David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these, for I have not tested them.” So David put them off. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones from the brook and put them in his shepherd’s pouch. His sling was in his hand, and he approached the Philistine.</p>\n<p id=\"p09017040_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine moved forward and came near to David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>And when the Philistine looked and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth, ruddy and handsome in appearance. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017043-1\">43&nbsp;</b>And the Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017044-1\">44&nbsp;</b>The Philistine said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the field.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017045-1\">45&nbsp;</b>Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017046-1\">46&nbsp;</b>This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017047-1\">47&nbsp;</b>and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear. For the battle is the LORD’s, and he will give you into our hand.”</p>\n<p id=\"p09017047_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017048-1\">48&nbsp;</b>When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017049-1\">49&nbsp;</b>And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone and slung it and struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"p09017049_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017050-1\">50&nbsp;</b>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. There was no sword in the hand of David. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017051-1\">51&nbsp;</b>Then David ran and stood over the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017052-1\">52&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017053-1\">53&nbsp;</b>And the people of Israel came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017054-1\">54&nbsp;</b>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.</p>\n<p id=\"p09017054_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017055-1\">55&nbsp;</b>As soon as Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this youth?” And Abner said, “As your soul lives, O king, I do not know.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017056-1\">56&nbsp;</b>And the king said, “Inquire whose son the boy is.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017057-1\">57&nbsp;</b>And as soon as David returned from the striking down of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017058-1\">58&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.”</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim.  <strong>2</strong> And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.  <strong>3</strong> And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.  <strong>4</strong> And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.  <strong>5</strong> And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was  armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was  five thousand shekels of brass.  <strong>6</strong> And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.  <strong>7</strong> And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.  <strong>8</strong> And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.  <strong>9</strong> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.  <strong>10</strong> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.  <strong>11</strong> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  <strong>12</strong> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.  <strong>13</strong> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <strong>14</strong> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.  <strong>15</strong> But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.  <strong>16</strong> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;  <strong>18</strong> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.  <strong>19</strong> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.  <strong>20</strong> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.  <strong>21</strong> For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.  <strong>22</strong> And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.  <strong>23</strong> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.  <strong>24</strong> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.  <strong>25</strong> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.  <strong>26</strong> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?  <strong>27</strong> And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.  <strong>28</strong> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.  <strong>29</strong> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?  <strong>30</strong> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.  <strong>31</strong> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.  <strong>32</strong> And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.  <strong>33</strong> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.  <strong>34</strong> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:  <strong>35</strong> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it  out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him  by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.  <strong>36</strong> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.  <strong>37</strong> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.  <strong>39</strong> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.  <strong>40</strong> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.  <strong>41</strong> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.  <strong>42</strong> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.  <strong>43</strong> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <strong>44</strong> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.  <strong>45</strong> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.  <strong>46</strong> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.  <strong>47</strong> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.  <strong>48</strong> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  <strong>49</strong> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.  <strong>50</strong> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.  <strong>51</strong> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.  <strong>52</strong> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.  <strong>53</strong> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.  <strong>54</strong> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.  <strong>55</strong> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.  <strong>56</strong> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.  <strong>57</strong> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  <strong>58</strong> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou  young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, \"Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the Philistine said, \"This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now Jesse said to his son David, \"Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now the Israelites had been saying, \"Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> David asked the men standing near him, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, \"This is what will be done for the man who kills him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, \"Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Now what have I done?\" said David. \"Can't I even speak?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Saul, \"Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" Saul said to David, \"Go, and the LORD be with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. \"I cannot go in these,\" he said to Saul, \"because I am not used to them.\" So he took them off. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Come here,\" he said, \"and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> David said to the Philistine, \"You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is that young man?\" Abner replied, \"As surely as you live, O king, I don't know.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The king said, \"Find out whose son this young man is.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"Whose son are you, young man?\" Saul asked him. David said, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.\" ","modified":"2022-12-05T15:51:12.033Z"},{"_id":"615d001fe4f8ad1e13fa85a9","topicId":"615d001ee4f8ad1e13fa85a7","verse":"1 Samuel 17:45","votes":38,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p09017045_01-3\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017045-1\">45&nbsp;</b>Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>45</strong> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
