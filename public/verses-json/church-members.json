 <strong>12</strong> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  <strong>13</strong> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  <strong>14</strong> For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.  <strong>15</strong> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  <strong>16</strong> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  <strong>17</strong> For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  <strong>18</strong> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.  <strong>19</strong> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  <strong>20</strong> And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:  <strong>21</strong> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art  a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)  <strong>22</strong> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.  <strong>23</strong> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  <strong>24</strong> But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.  <strong>25</strong> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  <strong>26</strong> For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  <strong>27</strong> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.  <strong>28</strong> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means \"king of righteousness\"; then also, \"king of Salem\" means \"king of peace.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people--that is, their brothers--even though their brothers are descended from Abraham. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why was there still need for another priest to come--one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For it is declared: \"You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> (for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: \"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Such a high priest meets our need--one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
