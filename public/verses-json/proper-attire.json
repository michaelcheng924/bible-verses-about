But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p46011016_06-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>When you come together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in?

What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.

(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)  <strong>7</strong> Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)  <strong>8</strong> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;  <strong>9</strong> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  <strong>10</strong> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  <strong>11</strong> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  <strong>12</strong> For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  <strong>13</strong> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>14</strong> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  <strong>15</strong> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  <strong>16</strong> But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.  <strong>20</strong> But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.  <strong>21</strong> But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: \"The man who does these things will live by them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the righteousness that is by faith says: \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'\" (that is, to bring Christ down) <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"or 'Who will descend into the deep?'\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But what does it say? \"The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,\" that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> That if you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As the Scripture says, \"Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for, \"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in?

Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus gave them this answer: \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> yet you refuse to come to me to have life. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"I do not accept praise from men, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God? <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?\" "},{"_id":"616a0bb4bda5ba8d73708b6c","topicId":"616a0bafbda5ba8d73708b5a","verse":"John 3:18","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43003018_01-21\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43003018-1\">18&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

 <strong>2</strong> And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  <strong>3</strong> And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>4</strong> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>5</strong> And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.  <strong>6</strong> But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. <strong>7</strong>           Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  <strong>8</strong> Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.  <strong>9</strong> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  <strong>10</strong> Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  <strong>12</strong> How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?
