The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  <strong>17</strong> For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.  <strong>18</strong> Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  <strong>19</strong> What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?  <strong>20</strong> But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.  <strong>21</strong> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.  <strong>22</strong> Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?  <strong>23</strong> All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.  <strong>24</strong> Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.  <strong>25</strong> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:  <strong>26</strong> For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.  <strong>27</strong> If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.  <strong>28</strong> But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:  <strong>29</strong> Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man’s conscience?  <strong>30</strong> For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?  <strong>31</strong> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.  <strong>32</strong> Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:  <strong>33</strong> Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They all ate the same spiritual food <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered over the desert. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: \"The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did--and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> We should not test the Lord, as some of them did--and were killed by snakes. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And do not grumble, as some of them did--and were killed by the destroying angel. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is beneficial. \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is constructive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> for, \"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if anyone says to you, \"This has been offered in sacrifice,\" then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake-- <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God-- <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.

he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.  <strong>40</strong> And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.  <strong>41</strong> And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be  an abomination; it shall not be eaten.  <strong>42</strong> Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all  four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.  <strong>43</strong> Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.  <strong>44</strong> For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  <strong>45</strong> For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.  <strong>46</strong> This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:  <strong>47</strong> To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Say to the Israelites: 'Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"'There are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The coney, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'Of all the creatures living in the water of the seas and the streams, you may eat any that have fins and scales. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But all creatures in the seas or streams that do not have fins and scales-whether among all the swarming things or among all the other living creatures in the water-you are to detest. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"'These are the birds you are to detest and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> the red kite, any kind of black kite, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> any kind of raven, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be detestable to you. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> There are, however, some winged creatures that walk on all fours that you may eat: those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Of these you may eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket or grasshopper. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But all other winged creatures that have four legs you are to detest. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"'You will make yourselves unclean by these; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'Every animal that has a split hoof not completely divided or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them will be unclean. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Of all the animals that walk on all fours, those that walk on their paws are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. They are unclean for you. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"'Of the animals that move about on the ground, these are unclean for you: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> the gecko, the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink and the chameleon. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Of all those that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide or sackcloth. Put it in water; it will be unclean till evening, and then it will be clean. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean, and you must break the pot. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Any food that could be eaten but has water on it from such a pot is unclean, and any liquid that could be drunk from it is unclean. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean, and you are to regard them as unclean. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> A spring, however, or a cistern for collecting water remains clean, but anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> If a carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted, they remain clean. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean for you. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"'If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches the carcass will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Anyone who eats some of the carcass must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"'Every creature that moves about on the ground is detestable; it is not to be eaten. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> You are not to eat any creature that moves about on the ground, whether it moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet; it is detestable. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves unclean by means of them or be made unclean by them. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I am the LORD your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves about on the ground. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> I am the LORD who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"'These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing that moves in the water and every creature that moves about on the ground. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.'\" "}]}
