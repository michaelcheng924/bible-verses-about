In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.

If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  <strong>10</strong> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.  <strong>11</strong> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  <strong>12</strong> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  <strong>13</strong> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.  <strong>14</strong> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  <strong>15</strong> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  <strong>16</strong> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.  <strong>17</strong> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.  <strong>18</strong> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:  <strong>19</strong> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  <strong>20</strong> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <strong>22</strong> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  <strong>24</strong> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  <strong>25</strong> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:  <strong>26</strong> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?  <strong>27</strong> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.  <strong>28</strong> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.  <strong>29</strong> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.  <strong>30</strong> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.  <strong>31</strong> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.  <strong>32</strong> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <strong>33</strong> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,  <strong>34</strong> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.  <strong>35</strong> Jesus wept.  <strong>36</strong> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!  <strong>37</strong> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?  <strong>38</strong> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.  <strong>39</strong> Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.  <strong>40</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  <strong>41</strong> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.  <strong>42</strong> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.  <strong>43</strong> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  <strong>44</strong> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  <strong>45</strong> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.  <strong>46</strong> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.  <strong>47</strong> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.  <strong>48</strong> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.  <strong>49</strong> And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,  <strong>50</strong> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.  <strong>51</strong> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;  <strong>52</strong> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.  <strong>53</strong> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.  <strong>54</strong> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.  <strong>55</strong> And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.  <strong>56</strong> Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?  <strong>57</strong> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.  <strong>1</strong> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.  <strong>2</strong> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.  <strong>3</strong> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.  <strong>4</strong> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son,  which should betray him,  <strong>5</strong> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?  <strong>6</strong> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.  <strong>7</strong> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.  <strong>8</strong> For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.  <strong>9</strong> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.  <strong>10</strong> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;  <strong>11</strong> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.  <strong>12</strong> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,  <strong>13</strong> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.  <strong>14</strong> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,  <strong>15</strong> Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.  <strong>16</strong> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.  <strong>17</strong> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.  <strong>18</strong> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.  <strong>19</strong> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.  <strong>20</strong> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:  <strong>21</strong> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.  <strong>22</strong> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.  <strong>23</strong> And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.  <strong>24</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.  <strong>25</strong> He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.  <strong>26</strong> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.  <strong>27</strong> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.  <strong>28</strong> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.  <strong>29</strong> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.  <strong>30</strong> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.  <strong>31</strong> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.  <strong>32</strong> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men  unto me.  <strong>33</strong> This he said, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>34</strong> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?  who is this Son of man?  <strong>35</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.  <strong>36</strong> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.  <strong>37</strong> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:  <strong>38</strong> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  <strong>39</strong> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,  <strong>40</strong> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  <strong>41</strong> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.  <strong>42</strong> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:  <strong>43</strong> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.  <strong>44</strong> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.  <strong>45</strong> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.  <strong>46</strong> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.  <strong>47</strong> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.  <strong>48</strong> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.  <strong>49</strong> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  <strong>50</strong> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.

David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\"--which means, \"God with us.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.

He will take great delight in you, he will quiet you with his love, he will rejoice over you with singing.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"The sorrows for the appointed feasts I will remove from you; they are a burden and a reproach to you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> At that time I will deal with all who oppressed you; I will rescue the lame and gather those who have been scattered. I will give them praise and honor in every land where they were put to shame. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes before your very eyes,\" says the LORD.

and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.  <strong>8</strong> And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things?  <strong>9</strong> And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.  <strong>10</strong> Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.
