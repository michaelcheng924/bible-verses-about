And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"Why were you searching for me?\" he asked. \"Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But they did not understand what he was saying to them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For he is God's servant to do you good.
