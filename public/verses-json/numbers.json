Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.  <strong>23</strong> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.  <strong>24</strong> But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.  <strong>25</strong> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.  <strong>26</strong> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.  <strong>27</strong> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.  <strong>28</strong> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?  <strong>29</strong> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.  <strong>30</strong> And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.  <strong>31</strong> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.  <strong>32</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:  <strong>33</strong> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.  <strong>34</strong> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.  <strong>35</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.  <strong>36</strong> And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is  in the utmost coast.  <strong>37</strong> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?  <strong>38</strong> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.  <strong>39</strong> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.  <strong>40</strong> And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.  <strong>41</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, \"This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.\" So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the River, in his native land. Balak said: \"A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Spend the night here,\" Balaam said to them, \"and I will bring you back the answer the LORD gives me.\" So the Moabite princes stayed with him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> God came to Balaam and asked, \"Who are these men with you?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Balaam said to God, \"Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> 'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But God said to Balaam, \"Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's princes, \"Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So the Moabite princes returned to Balak and said, \"Balaam refused to come with us.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They came to Balaam and said: \"This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Balaam answered them, \"Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now stay here tonight as the others did, and I will find out what else the LORD will tell me.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> That night God came to Balaam and said, \"Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat her to get her back on the road. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat her again. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat her with his staff. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, \"What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Balaam answered the donkey, \"You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The donkey said to Balaam, \"Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?No,\" he said. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD asked him, \"Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, \"I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, \"Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.\" So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Balak said to Balaam, \"Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"Well, I have come to you now,\" Balaam replied. \"But can I say just anything? I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the princes who were with him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he saw part of the people.

Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean; his uncleanness remains on him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent: Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or someone who has been killed or someone who has died a natural death. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify him. The person being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and that evening he will be clean. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But if a person who is unclean does not purify himself, he must be cut off from the community, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, and he is unclean. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> This is a lasting ordinance for them. \"The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening.\" "},{"_id":"6168d2713b32607a097c1b22","topicId":"6168d26b3b32607a097c1b11","verse":"Genesis 2:7","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p01002007_01-18\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01002007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>7</strong> And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
