Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he may be. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The entire law is summed up in a single command: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other. ","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.  <strong>2</strong> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.  <strong>3</strong> For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.  <strong>4</strong> Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.  <strong>5</strong> For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.  <strong>6</strong> For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.  <strong>7</strong> Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?  <strong>8</strong> This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.  <strong>9</strong> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.  <strong>10</strong> I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.  <strong>11</strong> And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.  <strong>12</strong> I would they were even cut off which trouble you.  <strong>13</strong> For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use  not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.  <strong>14</strong> For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <strong>15</strong> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.  <strong>16</strong> This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.  <strong>17</strong> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.  <strong>18</strong> But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.  <strong>19</strong> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these;  Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,  <strong>20</strong> Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,  <strong>21</strong> Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.  <strong>22</strong> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,  <strong>23</strong> Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.  <strong>24</strong> And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.  <strong>25</strong> If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.  <strong>26</strong> Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
