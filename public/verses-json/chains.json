And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  <strong>15</strong> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  <strong>16</strong> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  <strong>17</strong> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  <strong>18</strong> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  <strong>19</strong> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:  <strong>20</strong> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. <strong>21</strong> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  <strong>23</strong> But he answered her not a word.
