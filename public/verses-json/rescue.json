me.  <strong>18</strong> They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.  <strong>19</strong> But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.  <strong>20</strong> Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.  <strong>21</strong> Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.  <strong>22</strong> I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.  <strong>23</strong> Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.  <strong>24</strong> For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.  <strong>25</strong> My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.  <strong>26</strong> The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.  <strong>27</strong> All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.  <strong>28</strong> For the kingdom is the LORD’S: and he is the governor among the nations.  <strong>29</strong> All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.  <strong>30</strong> A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.  <strong>31</strong> They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from the words of my groaning? <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> O my God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, and am not silent. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the praise of Israel. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In you our fathers put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They cried to you and were saved; in you they trusted and were not disappointed. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by men and despised by the people. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads: <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you even at my mother's breast. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> From birth I was cast upon you; from my mother's womb you have been my God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Roaring lions tearing their prey open their mouths wide against me. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted away within me. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Dogs have surrounded me; a band of evil men has encircled me, they have pierced my hands and my feet. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I can count all my bones; people stare and gloat over me. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But you, O LORD, be not far off; O my Strength, come quickly to help me. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Deliver my life from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dogs. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Rescue me from the mouth of the lions; save me from the horns of the wild oxen. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will declare your name to my brothers; in the congregation I will praise you. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! Revere him, all you descendants of Israel! <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For he has not despised or disdained the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you will I fulfill my vows. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The poor will eat and be satisfied; they who seek the LORD will praise him- may your hearts live forever! <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> All the ends of the earth will remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations will bow down before him, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> for dominion belongs to the LORD and he rules over the nations. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> All the rich of the earth will feast and worship; all who go down to the dust will kneel before him- those who cannot keep themselves alive. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Posterity will serve him; future generations will be told about the Lord. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> They will proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn- for he has done it.
