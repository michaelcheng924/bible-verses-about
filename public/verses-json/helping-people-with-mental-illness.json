When he was in the house, he asked them, \"What were you arguing about on the road?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, \"If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" said John, \"we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Do not stop him,\" Jesus said. \"No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> for whoever is not against us is for us. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.
