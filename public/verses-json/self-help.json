If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.  <strong>16</strong> And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.  <strong>17</strong> And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.  <strong>18</strong> And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.  <strong>19</strong> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was  Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.  <strong>20</strong> And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.  <strong>21</strong> And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.  <strong>22</strong> And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.  <strong>23</strong> And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.  <strong>24</strong> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.  <strong>25</strong> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.  <strong>26</strong> And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, \"With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Cain, \"Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now Cain said to his brother Abel, \"Let's go out to the field.\" And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Cain, \"Where is your brother Abel?I don't know,\" he replied. \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The LORD said, \"What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Cain said to the LORD, \"My punishment is more than I can bear. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the LORD said to him, \"Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.\" Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Lamech said to his wives, \"Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, \"God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of the LORD.
