And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.  <strong>15</strong> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,  <strong>16</strong> And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?  <strong>18</strong> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.  <strong>19</strong> And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. <strong>20</strong> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:  <strong>21</strong> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.  <strong>22</strong> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not seeit.  <strong>23</strong> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.  <strong>24</strong> For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part  under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.  <strong>25</strong> But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.  <strong>26</strong> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.  <strong>27</strong> They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.  <strong>28</strong> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  <strong>29</strong> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.  <strong>30</strong> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.  <strong>31</strong> In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.  <strong>32</strong> Remember Lot’s wife.  <strong>33</strong> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.  <strong>34</strong> I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.  <strong>35</strong> Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>36</strong> Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>37</strong> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?

Where are the other nine? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then he said to him, \"Rise and go; your faith has made you well.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, \"The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then he said to his disciples, \"The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Men will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark.

This is he which received seed by the way side.  <strong>20</strong> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  <strong>21</strong> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.  <strong>22</strong> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  <strong>23</strong> But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. <strong>24</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:  <strong>25</strong> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.  <strong>26</strong> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.  <strong>27</strong> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  <strong>28</strong> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  <strong>29</strong> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.  <strong>30</strong> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. <strong>31</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:  <strong>32</strong> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <strong>33</strong> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  <strong>34</strong> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  <strong>35</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  <strong>36</strong> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;  <strong>38</strong> The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;  <strong>39</strong> The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  <strong>40</strong> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.  <strong>41</strong> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;  <strong>42</strong> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>43</strong> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <strong>44</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. <strong>45</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:  <strong>46</strong> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. <strong>47</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:  <strong>48</strong> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.  <strong>49</strong> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  <strong>50</strong> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>51</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?  They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  <strong>52</strong> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is  instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. <strong>53</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.  <strong>54</strong> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  <strong>55</strong> Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  <strong>56</strong> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?  <strong>57</strong> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.  <strong>58</strong> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then he told them many things in parables, saying: \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He who has ears, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The disciples came to him and asked, \"Why do you speak to the people in parables?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He replied, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is why I speak to them in parables: \"Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: \"'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"'An enemy did this,' he replied. \"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"Have you understood all these things?\" Jesus asked. \"Yes,\" they replied. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\" they asked. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> \"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.  <strong>13</strong> Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist.  <strong>14</strong> And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,  <strong>15</strong> Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the water.  <strong>16</strong> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.  <strong>17</strong> Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.  <strong>18</strong> And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.  <strong>19</strong> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?  <strong>20</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.  <strong>21</strong> Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.  <strong>22</strong> And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:  <strong>23</strong> And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.  <strong>24</strong> And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?  <strong>25</strong> He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?  <strong>26</strong> Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free.  <strong>27</strong> Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Peter said to Jesus, \"Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But Jesus came and touched them. \"Get up,\" he said. \"Don't be afraid.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, \"Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The disciples asked him, \"Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Lord, have mercy on my son,\" he said. \"He has seizures and is suffering greatly.

How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, \"Why couldn't we drive it out?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He replied, \"Because you have so little faith.
