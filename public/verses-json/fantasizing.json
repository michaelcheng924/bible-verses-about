And earth has nothing I desire besides you. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.

He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.  <strong>24</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  <strong>25</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.  <strong>26</strong> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;  <strong>27</strong> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.  <strong>28</strong> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,  <strong>29</strong> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.  <strong>30</strong> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.  <strong>31</strong> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. <strong>32</strong>           There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  <strong>33</strong> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.  <strong>34</strong> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.  <strong>35</strong> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. <strong>36</strong>           But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.  <strong>37</strong> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, \"Do you want to get well?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the invalid replied, \"I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to him, \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \"It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But he replied, \"The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus gave them this answer: \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"I have testimony weightier than that of John.
