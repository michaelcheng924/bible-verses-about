I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land.

Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says to them: See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered.

I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The trees of the field will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them.
