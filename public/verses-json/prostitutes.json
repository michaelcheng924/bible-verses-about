Thus were  their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.  <strong>5</strong> And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,  <strong>6</strong> Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.  <strong>7</strong> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were  the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.  <strong>8</strong> Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.  <strong>9</strong> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.  <strong>10</strong> These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.  <strong>11</strong> And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.  <strong>12</strong> She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.  <strong>13</strong> Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took  both one way,  <strong>14</strong> And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,  <strong>15</strong> Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:  <strong>16</strong> And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.  <strong>17</strong> And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.  <strong>18</strong> So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.  <strong>19</strong> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.  <strong>20</strong> For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  <strong>21</strong> Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;  <strong>23</strong> The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.  <strong>24</strong> And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.  <strong>25</strong> And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.  <strong>26</strong> They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.  <strong>27</strong> Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.  <strong>28</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:  <strong>29</strong> And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>30</strong> I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.  <strong>31</strong> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.  <strong>32</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.  <strong>33</strong> Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.  <strong>34</strong> Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>35</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>36</strong> The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;  <strong>37</strong> That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.  <strong>38</strong> Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.  <strong>39</strong> For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.  <strong>40</strong> And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,  <strong>41</strong> And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.  <strong>42</strong> And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.  <strong>43</strong> Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  <strong>44</strong> Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.  <strong>45</strong> And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.  <strong>46</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.  <strong>47</strong> And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.  <strong>48</strong> Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.  <strong>49</strong> And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you naked and bare, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> have brought this upon you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"You will drink your sister's cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You will drink it and drain it dry; you will dash it to pieces and tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have forgotten me and thrust me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The LORD said to me: \"Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, painted your eyes and put on your jewelry. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and oil that belonged to me. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; Sabeans were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the arms of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, 'Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.\" "},{"_id":"616a0d43bda5ba8d73708c66","topicId":"616a0d41bda5ba8d73708c5e","verse":"Galatians 5:19-21","votes":8,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p48005019_01-10\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v48005019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v48005020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v48005021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these.
