joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.  <strong>2</strong> And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.  <strong>3</strong> And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,  <strong>4</strong> That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!  <strong>5</strong> The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.  <strong>6</strong> He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.  <strong>7</strong> The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.  <strong>8</strong> Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.  <strong>9</strong> Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.  <strong>10</strong> All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?  <strong>11</strong> Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.  <strong>12</strong> How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!  <strong>13</strong> For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:  <strong>14</strong> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.  <strong>15</strong> Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.  <strong>16</strong> They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;  <strong>17</strong> That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?  <strong>18</strong> All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.  <strong>19</strong> But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.  <strong>20</strong> Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.  <strong>21</strong> Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.  <strong>22</strong> For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.  <strong>24</strong> The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:  <strong>25</strong> That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.  <strong>26</strong> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.  <strong>27</strong> For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?  and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?  <strong>28</strong> In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.  <strong>29</strong> Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.  <strong>30</strong> And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.  <strong>31</strong> Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.  <strong>32</strong> What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD will have compassion on Jacob; once again he will choose Israel and will settle them in their own land. Aliens will join them and unite with the house of Jacob. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Nations will take them and bring them to their own place. And the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD's land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> On the day the LORD gives you relief from suffering and turmoil and cruel bondage, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended! <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD has broken the rod of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> which in anger struck down peoples with unceasing blows, and in fury subdued nations with relentless aggression. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> All the lands are at rest and at peace; they break into singing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Even the pine trees and the cedars of Lebanon exult over you and say, \"Now that you have been laid low, no woodsman comes to cut us down.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The grave below is all astir to meet you at your coming; it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you- all those who were leaders in the world; it makes them rise from their thrones- all those who were kings over the nations. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They will all respond, they will say to you, \"You also have become weak, as we are; you have become like us.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You said in your heart, \"I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But you are brought down to the grave, to the depths of the pit. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: \"Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> the man who made the world a desert, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"I will rise up against them,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \"I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors, her offspring and descendants,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,\" declares the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn, \"Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Wail, O gate! Howl, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? \"The LORD has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.\" "}]}
