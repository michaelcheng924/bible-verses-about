And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.  <strong>2</strong> And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were  in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.  <strong>3</strong> Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.  <strong>4</strong> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.  <strong>5</strong> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:  <strong>6</strong> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.  <strong>7</strong> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.  <strong>8</strong> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.  <strong>9</strong> And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.  <strong>10</strong> And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.  <strong>11</strong> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?  <strong>12</strong> So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.  <strong>13</strong> And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.  <strong>14</strong> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.  <strong>15</strong> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:  <strong>16</strong> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.  <strong>17</strong> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.  <strong>18</strong> Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn,  and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.  <strong>19</strong> And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.  <strong>20</strong> And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.  <strong>21</strong> Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow  hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.  <strong>22</strong> So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.  <strong>23</strong> And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,  <strong>24</strong> And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.  <strong>25</strong> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even  Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.  <strong>26</strong> Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as  thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.  <strong>27</strong> And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.  <strong>28</strong> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.  <strong>29</strong> Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.  <strong>30</strong> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;  <strong>31</strong> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.  <strong>32</strong> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:  <strong>33</strong> And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.  <strong>34</strong> For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.  <strong>35</strong> So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.  <strong>36</strong> And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.  <strong>37</strong> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.  <strong>38</strong> And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.  <strong>39</strong> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be  the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.  <strong>40</strong> And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife.  <strong>41</strong> And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.  <strong>42</strong> And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.  <strong>43</strong> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.  <strong>44</strong> But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Maon. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was surly and mean in his dealings. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So he sent ten young men and said to them, \"Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Say to him: 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours! <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Nabal answered David's servants, \"Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> David said to his men, \"Put on your swords!\" So they put on their swords, and David put on his. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> One of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail: \"David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then she told her servants, \"Go on ahead; I'll follow you.\" But she did not tell her husband Nabal. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> David had just said, \"It's been useless-all my watching over this fellow's property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She fell at his feet and said: \"My lord, let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> May my lord pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name-his name is Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my master sent. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Now since the LORD has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like Nabal. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Please forgive your servant's offense, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the LORD's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When the LORD has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over Israel, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the LORD has brought my master success, remember your servant.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Abigail, \"Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, \"Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \"Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head.\" Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, \"David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, \"Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's servants.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David's messengers and became his wife. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.

Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  <strong>10</strong> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  <strong>11</strong> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  <strong>13</strong> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  <strong>14</strong> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  <strong>15</strong> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  <strong>16</strong> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  <strong>17</strong> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  <strong>18</strong> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are  not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.  <strong>19</strong> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  <strong>20</strong> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  <strong>21</strong> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  <strong>22</strong> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  <strong>23</strong> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  <strong>24</strong> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  <strong>25</strong> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  <strong>26</strong> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  <strong>27</strong> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  <strong>28</strong> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  <strong>29</strong> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  <strong>30</strong> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  <strong>31</strong> What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?  <strong>32</strong> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  <strong>33</strong> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.  <strong>9</strong> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my  hands and my head.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.  <strong>11</strong> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.  <strong>12</strong> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?  <strong>13</strong> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.  <strong>14</strong> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.  <strong>15</strong> For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.  <strong>16</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.  <strong>17</strong> If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. <strong>18</strong>           I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.  <strong>19</strong> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.  <strong>20</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  <strong>21</strong> When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  <strong>22</strong> Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.  <strong>23</strong> Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.  <strong>24</strong> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.  <strong>25</strong> He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.

Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.  <strong>8</strong> Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:  <strong>9</strong> But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.  <strong>10</strong> And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.  <strong>11</strong> And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto  magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:  <strong>12</strong> For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say. <strong>13</strong> And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.  <strong>14</strong> And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?  <strong>15</strong> And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.  <strong>16</strong> And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:  <strong>17</strong> And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?  <strong>18</strong> And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.  <strong>19</strong> And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.  <strong>20</strong> But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?  <strong>21</strong> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. <strong>22</strong> And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.  <strong>23</strong> The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.  <strong>24</strong> Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?  <strong>25</strong> And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?  <strong>26</strong> If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?  <strong>27</strong> Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <strong>28</strong> If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?  <strong>29</strong> And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.  <strong>30</strong> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. <strong>31</strong>           But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>32</strong> Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.  <strong>33</strong> Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.  <strong>34</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>35</strong> Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;  <strong>36</strong> And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.  <strong>37</strong> Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.  <strong>38</strong> And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.  <strong>39</strong> And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.  <strong>40</strong> Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. <strong>41</strong> Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?  <strong>42</strong> And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?  <strong>43</strong> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  <strong>44</strong> Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.  <strong>45</strong> But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;  <strong>46</strong> The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.  <strong>47</strong> And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.  <strong>48</strong> But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. <strong>49</strong>           I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?  <strong>50</strong> But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!  <strong>51</strong> Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?

Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he told them this parable: \"The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\"' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Consider how the lilies grow.

Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Peter asked, \"Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The Lord answered, \"Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  <strong>15</strong> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  <strong>16</strong> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <strong>17</strong>           Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  <strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <strong>21</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  <strong>24</strong> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <strong>25</strong> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  <strong>26</strong> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <strong>27</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  <strong>28</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  <strong>29</strong> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>30</strong> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>31</strong> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  <strong>32</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <strong>33</strong>           Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  <strong>34</strong> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  <strong>35</strong> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  <strong>36</strong> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  <strong>37</strong> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <strong>38</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  <strong>39</strong> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  <strong>40</strong> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.  <strong>41</strong> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  <strong>42</strong> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <strong>43</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  <strong>44</strong> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  <strong>45</strong> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  <strong>46</strong> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?

But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get?
