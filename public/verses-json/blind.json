He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.  <strong>8</strong> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  <strong>9</strong> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but  he said, I am he.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  <strong>11</strong> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash:  and I went and washed, and I received sight.  <strong>12</strong> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.  <strong>13</strong> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.  <strong>14</strong> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  <strong>15</strong> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.

Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.  <strong>17</strong> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?

And they cast him out.  <strong>35</strong> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  <strong>36</strong> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  <strong>37</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.  <strong>39</strong> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.  <strong>40</strong> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  <strong>41</strong> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

It was your eyes he opened.\" The man replied, \"He is a prophet.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Is this your son?\" they asked. \"Is this the one you say was born blind?

Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> That was why his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \"Give glory to God, \"they said. \"We know this man is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He replied, \"Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He answered, \"I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they hurled insults at him and said, \"You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The man answered, \"Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> To this they replied, \"You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!\" And they threw him out. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked. \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the man said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What?
