And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.  <strong>14</strong> Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.  <strong>15</strong> But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  <strong>16</strong> And charged them that they should not make him known:  <strong>17</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  <strong>18</strong> Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.  <strong>19</strong> He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.  <strong>20</strong> A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.  <strong>21</strong> And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.  <strong>22</strong> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw.  <strong>23</strong> And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David?  <strong>24</strong> But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow  doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.  <strong>25</strong> And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:  <strong>26</strong> And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?  <strong>27</strong> And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.  <strong>28</strong> But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.  <strong>29</strong> Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.  <strong>30</strong> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. <strong>31</strong>           Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy  Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.  <strong>32</strong> And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.  <strong>33</strong> Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. <strong>34</strong> O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.  <strong>35</strong> A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.  <strong>36</strong> But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.  <strong>37</strong> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. <strong>38</strong> Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.  <strong>39</strong> But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:  <strong>40</strong> For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.  <strong>41</strong> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.  <strong>42</strong> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  <strong>43</strong> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  <strong>44</strong> Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.  <strong>45</strong> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. <strong>46</strong> While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  <strong>47</strong> Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  <strong>48</strong> But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?  <strong>49</strong> And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!  <strong>50</strong> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, \"Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He answered, \"Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread--which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I tell you that one greater than the temple is here. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, \"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He said to them, \"If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> warning them not to tell who he was. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In his name the nations will put their hope.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> All the people were astonished and said, \"Could this be the Son of David?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, \"It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, \"Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He answered, \"A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He replied to him, \"Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Pointing to his disciples, he said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.\" "},{"_id":"616a2ca3a03c6e96020b977d","topicId":"616a2c9ca03c6e96020b9769","verse":"John 6:28-29","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43006028_01-21\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43006028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Then they said to him, “What must we do, to be doing the works of God?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43006029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>Jesus answered them, <span class=\"woc\">“This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>28</strong> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  <strong>29</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
