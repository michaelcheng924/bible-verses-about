","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> And Saul was there, giving approval to his death. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So there was great joy in that city. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, \"This man is the divine power known as the Great Power.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and said, \"Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter answered: \"May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Simon answered, \"Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \"Go south to the road--the desert road--that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The Spirit told Philip, \"Go to that chariot and stay near it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: \"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \"Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.

You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"616799f6a3a86b670bc2fcf3","topicId":"616799f3a3a86b670bc2fce9","verse":"Daniel 3:1-30","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p27003001_04-14\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v27003001-1\">3:1&nbsp;</b>King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits.

Then they brought these men before the king.  <strong>14</strong> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?  <strong>15</strong> Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?  <strong>16</strong> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.  <strong>17</strong> If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.  <strong>18</strong> But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.  <strong>19</strong> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.  <strong>20</strong> And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them  into the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>21</strong> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.  <strong>23</strong> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>24</strong> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?

So these men were brought before the king, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, \"Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good.

Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, \"Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?\" They replied, \"Certainly, O king.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said, \"Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!\" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \"Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a

<strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come

calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with

She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"616799f7a3a86b670bc2fcf7","topicId":"616799f3a3a86b670bc2fce9","verse":"Psalm 97:7","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19097007_01-18\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19097007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;All worshipers of images are put to shame,</span><br><span id=\"p19097007_01-18\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who make their boast in worthless idols;</span><br><span id=\"p19097007_01-18\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worship him, all you gods!</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>7</strong> Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.
