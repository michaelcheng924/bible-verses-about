Now the famine was severe in Samaria. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018006_04-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>And he said, “How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, ‘He is not here,’ he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’ <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”’; and he will kill me.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018016_04-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father’s house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”</p>\n\n<p id=\"p11018019_09-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal’s prophets are 450 men. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>And you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, he is God.” And all the people answered, “It is well spoken.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018029_09-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, “Israel shall be your name,” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And he said, “Do it a second time.” And they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time.” And they did it a third time. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018035_09-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p11018040_13-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of the rushing of rain.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel. And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018043-1\">43&nbsp;</b>And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” And he went up and looked and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go again,” seven times. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018044-1\">44&nbsp;</b>And at the seventh time he said, “Behold, a little cloud like a man’s hand is rising from the sea.” And he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018045-1\">45&nbsp;</b>And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018046-1\">46&nbsp;</b>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah, and he gathered up his garment and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>40</strong> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.

ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.  <strong>3</strong> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>4</strong> LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.  <strong>5</strong> The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.  <strong>7</strong> The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.  <strong>8</strong> They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  <strong>9</strong> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.  <strong>11</strong> They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants  of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.  <strong>12</strong> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.  <strong>13</strong> Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.  <strong>14</strong> Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.  <strong>15</strong> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.  <strong>16</strong> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.  <strong>17</strong> Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.  <strong>18</strong> Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.  <strong>19</strong> The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.  <strong>20</strong> They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.  <strong>21</strong> The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.  <strong>22</strong> Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.  <strong>23</strong> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.  <strong>24</strong> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.  <strong>25</strong> He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.  <strong>26</strong> She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.  <strong>27</strong> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.  <strong>28</strong> The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?  <strong>29</strong> Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,  <strong>30</strong> Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?  <strong>31</strong> So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves- praise the LORD! <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I will sing to the LORD, I will sing; I will make music to the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"O LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the roads were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Village life in Israel ceased, ceased until I, Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they chose new gods, war came to the city gates, and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the LORD! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> the voice of the singers at the watering places. They recite the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous acts of his warriors in Israel. \"Then the people of the LORD went down to the city gates. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> 'Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, O Barak! Take captive your captives, O son of Abinoam.' <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Then the men who were left came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came to me with the mighty. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's staff. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, rushing after him into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Why did you stay among the campfires to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the heights of the field. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Kings came, they fought; the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no silver, no plunder. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then thundered the horses' hoofs- galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> 'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD. 'Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell-dead. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> 'Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a girl or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck- all this as plunder?' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength.\" Then the land had peace forty years.

Don't be afraid.\" So he entered her tent, and she put a covering over him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"I'm thirsty,\" he said. \"Please give me some water.\" She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Stand in the doorway of the tent,\" he told her. \"If someone comes by and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say 'No.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted.

(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:  <strong>4</strong> For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  <strong>5</strong> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.  <strong>6</strong> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  <strong>7</strong> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  <strong>8</strong> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>9</strong> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  <strong>10</strong> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is  not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  <strong>11</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>12</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  <strong>13</strong> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <strong>14</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here:  and he shall slay me.  <strong>15</strong> And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.  <strong>16</strong> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.  <strong>20</strong> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.  <strong>21</strong> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him.

And they leaped upon the altar which was made.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.  <strong>28</strong> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  <strong>30</strong> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.  <strong>31</strong> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:  <strong>32</strong> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.  <strong>33</strong> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it  the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  <strong>35</strong> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that  I have done all these things at thy word.  <strong>37</strong> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.  <strong>38</strong> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.  <strong>39</strong> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.  <strong>40</strong> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.  <strong>41</strong> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.  <strong>42</strong> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,  <strong>43</strong> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.  <strong>44</strong> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.  <strong>45</strong> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.  <strong>46</strong> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: \"Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Ahab had said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, \"Is it really you, my lord Elijah?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What have I done wrong,\" asked Obadiah, \"that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Elijah said, \"As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he saw Elijah, he said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have not made trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Elijah went before the people and said, \"How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.\" But the people said nothing. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to them, \"I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire-he is God.\" Then all the people said, \"What you say is good.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. \"O Baal, answer us!\" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At noon Elijah began to taunt them. \"Shout louder!\" he said. \"Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come here to me.\" They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Your name shall be Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Do it again,\" he said, and they did it again. \"Do it a third time,\" he ordered, and they did it the third time. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, \"The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Elijah commanded them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!\" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Go and look toward the sea,\" he told his servant. And he went up and looked. \"There is nothing there,\" he said. Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The seventh time the servant reported, \"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" So Elijah said, \"Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.

The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, \"Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty-two months. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast--all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he will be killed.

He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This calls for wisdom.

Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.  <strong>32</strong> For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.  <strong>33</strong>           Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:  <strong>34</strong> And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.  <strong>35</strong> And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.  <strong>36</strong> Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.  <strong>37</strong> But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.  <strong>38</strong> But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.  <strong>39</strong> And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him. <strong>40</strong> When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?  <strong>41</strong> They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.  <strong>42</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  <strong>43</strong> Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.  <strong>44</strong> And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.  <strong>45</strong> And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.  <strong>46</strong> But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> saying to them, \"Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Say to the Daughter of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, \"Hosanna to the Son of David!Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Hosanna in the highest!\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, \"Who is this?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The crowds answered, \"This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"It is written,\" he said to them, \"'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, \"Hosanna to the Son of David,\" they were indignant. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Do you hear what these children are saying?\" they asked him. \"Yes,\" replied Jesus, \"have you never read, \"'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, \"May you never bear fruit again!\" Immediately the tree withered. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. \"How did the fig tree wither so quickly?\" they asked. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. \"By what authority are you doing these things?\" they asked. \"And who gave you this authority?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> John's baptism--where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They discussed it among themselves and said, \"If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' But if we say, 'From men'--we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So they answered Jesus, \"We don't know.\" Then he said, \"Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Which of the two did what his father wanted?The first,\" they answered. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you. For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"He will bring those wretches to a wretched end,\" they replied, \"and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Have you never read in the Scriptures: \"'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.

<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I

They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings!
