 <strong>9</strong> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?  <strong>10</strong> They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.  <strong>12</strong> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.  <strong>13</strong> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:  <strong>14</strong> So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.  <strong>15</strong> Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>16</strong> As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee.  <strong>17</strong> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.  <strong>18</strong> But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.  <strong>19</strong> And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?  <strong>20</strong> Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying,  <strong>21</strong> The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind?  <strong>22</strong> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.  <strong>23</strong> Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.  <strong>24</strong> Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:  <strong>25</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.  <strong>26</strong> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.  <strong>28</strong> Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.  <strong>29</strong> And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:  <strong>30</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.  <strong>1</strong> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch;  <strong>3</strong> Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.  <strong>4</strong> Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that  which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.  <strong>5</strong> And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This word came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews living in Lower Egypt-in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis -and in Upper Egypt: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You saw the great disaster I brought on Jerusalem and on all the towns of Judah. Today they lie deserted and in ruins <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> because of the evil they have done. They provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, 'Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!' <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Why provoke me to anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations on earth. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your fathers and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your fathers. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become an object of cursing and horror, of condemnation and reproach. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present-a large assembly-and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem.

Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.  <strong>7</strong> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  <strong>8</strong> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  <strong>9</strong> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  <strong>10</strong> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  <strong>11</strong> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.  <strong>12</strong> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.  <strong>13</strong> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  <strong>14</strong> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be  the Saviour of the world.  <strong>15</strong> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.  <strong>16</strong> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.  <strong>17</strong> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  <strong>18</strong> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  <strong>19</strong> We love him, because he first loved us.  <strong>20</strong> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  <strong>21</strong> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.  <strong>1</strong> Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.  <strong>2</strong> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.  <strong>3</strong> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.  <strong>4</strong> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.  <strong>5</strong> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?  <strong>6</strong> This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.  <strong>7</strong> For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.  <strong>8</strong> And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.  <strong>9</strong> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.  <strong>10</strong> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.  <strong>11</strong> And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  <strong>12</strong> He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.  <strong>13</strong> These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.  <strong>14</strong> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:  <strong>15</strong> And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  <strong>16</strong> If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.  <strong>17</strong> All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.  <strong>18</strong> We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.  <strong>19</strong> And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.  <strong>20</strong> And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.  <strong>21</strong> Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.
