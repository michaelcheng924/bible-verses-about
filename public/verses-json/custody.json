I go to prepare a place for you.  <strong>3</strong> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.  <strong>4</strong> And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.  <strong>5</strong> Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?  <strong>6</strong> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  <strong>7</strong> If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.  <strong>8</strong> Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.  <strong>9</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?  <strong>10</strong> Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.  <strong>11</strong> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.  <strong>12</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.  <strong>13</strong> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  <strong>14</strong> If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. <strong>15</strong>           If ye love me, keep my commandments.  <strong>16</strong> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;  <strong>17</strong> Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.  <strong>18</strong> I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.  <strong>19</strong> Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.  <strong>20</strong> At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.  <strong>21</strong> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.  <strong>22</strong> Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?  <strong>23</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.  <strong>24</strong> He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.  <strong>25</strong> These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.  <strong>26</strong> But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.  <strong>27</strong> Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.  <strong>28</strong> Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again  unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.  <strong>29</strong> And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.  <strong>30</strong> Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.  <strong>31</strong> But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. <strong>1</strong>           I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.  <strong>2</strong> Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.  <strong>3</strong> Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.  <strong>4</strong> Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.  <strong>5</strong> I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.  <strong>6</strong> If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.  <strong>7</strong> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.  <strong>8</strong> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.  <strong>9</strong> As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.  <strong>10</strong> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.  <strong>11</strong> These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.  <strong>12</strong> This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.  <strong>13</strong> Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.  <strong>14</strong> Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.  <strong>15</strong> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.  <strong>16</strong> Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.  <strong>17</strong> These things I command you, that ye love one another.  <strong>18</strong> If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.  <strong>19</strong> If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.  <strong>20</strong> Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.  <strong>21</strong> But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.  <strong>22</strong> If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.  <strong>23</strong> He that hateth me hateth my Father also.  <strong>24</strong> If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.  <strong>25</strong> But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.  <strong>26</strong> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:  <strong>27</strong> And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning. <strong>1</strong>           These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.  <strong>2</strong> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.  <strong>3</strong> And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.  <strong>4</strong> But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.  <strong>5</strong> But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?  <strong>6</strong> But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.  <strong>7</strong> Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.  <strong>8</strong> And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:  <strong>9</strong> Of sin, because they believe not on me;  <strong>10</strong> Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;  <strong>11</strong> Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.  <strong>12</strong> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.  <strong>13</strong> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.  <strong>14</strong> He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.  <strong>15</strong> All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.  <strong>16</strong> A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.  <strong>17</strong> Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?  <strong>18</strong> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.  <strong>19</strong> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?  <strong>20</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.  <strong>21</strong> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.  <strong>22</strong> And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.  <strong>23</strong> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it  you.  <strong>24</strong> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.  <strong>25</strong> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.  <strong>26</strong> At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:  <strong>27</strong> For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.  <strong>28</strong> I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.  <strong>29</strong> His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.  <strong>30</strong> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.  <strong>31</strong> Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?  <strong>32</strong> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.  <strong>33</strong> These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"Do not let your hearts be troubled.

In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as men rejoice when dividing the plunder. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For as in the day of Midian's defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Lord has sent a message against Jacob; it will fall on Israel. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> All the people will know it- Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria- who say with pride and arrogance of heart, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the LORD has strengthened Rezin's foes against them and has spurred their enemies on. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But the people have not returned to him who struck them, nor have they sought the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So the LORD will cut off from Israel both head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day; <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> the elders and prominent men are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men, nor will he pity the fatherless and widows, for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks vileness. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Surely wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns, it sets the forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> By the wrath of the LORD Almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire; no one will spare his brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> On the right they will devour, but still be hungry; on the left they will eat, but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh; together they will turn against Judah. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
