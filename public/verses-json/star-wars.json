(because he was of the house and lineage of David:)  <strong>5</strong> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.  <strong>6</strong> And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.  <strong>7</strong> And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.  <strong>8</strong> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  <strong>9</strong> And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.  <strong>10</strong> And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.  <strong>11</strong> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.  <strong>12</strong> And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.  <strong>13</strong> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,  <strong>14</strong> Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.  <strong>16</strong> And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.  <strong>17</strong> And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.  <strong>18</strong> And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.  <strong>19</strong> But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.  <strong>20</strong> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.  <strong>21</strong> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.  <strong>22</strong> And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;

She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the angel said to them, \"Do not be afraid.

When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For my eyes have seen your salvation, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> which you have prepared in the sight of all people, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: \"This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"Why were you searching for me?\" he asked. \"Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But they did not understand what he was saying to them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them.

But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  <strong>24</strong> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.  <strong>25</strong> Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.  <strong>26</strong> Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.  <strong>27</strong> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.  <strong>28</strong> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.  <strong>29</strong> And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it  upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!  <strong>30</strong> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.  <strong>31</strong> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.  <strong>32</strong> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.  <strong>33</strong> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,  <strong>34</strong> They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.  <strong>35</strong> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  <strong>36</strong> And sitting down they watched him there;  <strong>37</strong> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>38</strong> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.  <strong>39</strong> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,  <strong>40</strong> And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it  in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.  <strong>41</strong> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,  <strong>42</strong> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.  <strong>43</strong> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.  <strong>44</strong> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.  <strong>45</strong> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.  <strong>46</strong> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <strong>47</strong> Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.  <strong>48</strong> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  <strong>49</strong> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  <strong>51</strong> And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;  <strong>52</strong> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,  <strong>53</strong> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.  <strong>54</strong> Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.  <strong>55</strong> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  <strong>56</strong> Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.  <strong>57</strong> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:  <strong>58</strong> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.  <strong>59</strong> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  <strong>60</strong> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.  <strong>61</strong> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.  <strong>62</strong> Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  <strong>63</strong> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  <strong>64</strong> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.  <strong>65</strong> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it  as sure as ye can.  <strong>66</strong> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"I have sinned,\" he said, \"for I have betrayed innocent blood.What is that to us?\" they replied. \"That's your responsibility.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The chief priests picked up the coins and said, \"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Pilate asked him, \"Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \"Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: \"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\" asked the governor. \"Barabbas,\" they answered. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?\" Pilate asked. They all answered, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \"I am innocent of this man's blood,\" he said. \"It is your responsibility!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> All the people answered, \"Let his blood be on us and on our children!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" they said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> and saying, \"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The rest said, \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> \"Take a guard,\" Pilate answered. \"Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.  <strong>2</strong> And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.  <strong>3</strong> And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,  <strong>4</strong> That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!  <strong>5</strong> The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers.  <strong>6</strong> He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.  <strong>7</strong> The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.  <strong>8</strong> Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.  <strong>9</strong> Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.  <strong>10</strong> All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us?  <strong>11</strong> Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.  <strong>12</strong> How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!  <strong>13</strong> For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:  <strong>14</strong> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.  <strong>15</strong> Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.  <strong>16</strong> They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;  <strong>17</strong> That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?  <strong>18</strong> All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.  <strong>19</strong> But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.  <strong>20</strong> Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.  <strong>21</strong> Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.  <strong>22</strong> For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.  <strong>24</strong> The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:  <strong>25</strong> That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.  <strong>26</strong> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.  <strong>27</strong> For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?  and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?  <strong>28</strong> In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.  <strong>29</strong> Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.  <strong>30</strong> And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.  <strong>31</strong> Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.  <strong>32</strong> What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD will have compassion on Jacob; once again he will choose Israel and will settle them in their own land. Aliens will join them and unite with the house of Jacob. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Nations will take them and bring them to their own place. And the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD's land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> On the day the LORD gives you relief from suffering and turmoil and cruel bondage, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended! <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD has broken the rod of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> which in anger struck down peoples with unceasing blows, and in fury subdued nations with relentless aggression. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> All the lands are at rest and at peace; they break into singing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Even the pine trees and the cedars of Lebanon exult over you and say, \"Now that you have been laid low, no woodsman comes to cut us down.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The grave below is all astir to meet you at your coming; it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you- all those who were leaders in the world; it makes them rise from their thrones- all those who were kings over the nations. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They will all respond, they will say to you, \"You also have become weak, as we are; you have become like us.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You said in your heart, \"I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But you are brought down to the grave, to the depths of the pit. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: \"Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> the man who made the world a desert, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"I will rise up against them,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \"I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors, her offspring and descendants,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,\" declares the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn, \"Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Wail, O gate! Howl, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? \"The LORD has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.\" "},{"_id":"616af026c1af50acf0bc8d03","topicId":"616af01ec1af50acf0bc8cea","verse":"Isaiah 14:12","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p23014012_01-31\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23014012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;“How you are fallen from heaven,</span><br><span id=\"p23014012_01-31\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Day Star, son of Dawn!</span><br><span id=\"p23014012_01-31\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;How you are cut down to the ground,</span><br><span id=\"p23014012_01-31\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who laid the nations low!</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>12</strong> How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!
