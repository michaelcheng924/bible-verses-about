<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come

<strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed,

And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.  <strong>10</strong> Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:  <strong>11</strong> And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?

Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.  <strong>4</strong> So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.  <strong>5</strong> And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.  <strong>6</strong> And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.  <strong>7</strong> And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.  <strong>8</strong> For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:  <strong>9</strong> And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:  <strong>10</strong> And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.  <strong>11</strong> Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one  said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.  <strong>12</strong> And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.  <strong>13</strong> Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it  under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.  <strong>14</strong> So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.  <strong>15</strong> But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor  escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.  <strong>16</strong> So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.  <strong>17</strong> And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?  <strong>18</strong> So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.  <strong>19</strong> Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.  <strong>20</strong> And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.  <strong>21</strong> And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.  <strong>22</strong> And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it  peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?  <strong>23</strong> And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.  <strong>24</strong> And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.  <strong>25</strong> Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and  cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;  <strong>26</strong> Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground,  according to the word of the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.  <strong>28</strong> And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.  <strong>29</strong> And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.  <strong>30</strong> And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.  <strong>31</strong> And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?  <strong>32</strong> And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is  on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.  <strong>33</strong> And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some  of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot.  <strong>34</strong> And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king’s daughter.  <strong>35</strong> And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.  <strong>36</strong> Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is  the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:  <strong>37</strong> And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.  <strong>1</strong> And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab’s children, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour;  <strong>3</strong> Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.  <strong>4</strong> But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?  <strong>5</strong> And he that was over the house, and he that was  over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is  good in thine eyes.  <strong>6</strong> Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be  mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were  with the great men of the city, which brought them up.  <strong>7</strong> And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.  <strong>8</strong> And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.  <strong>9</strong> And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?  <strong>10</strong> Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.  <strong>11</strong> So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.  <strong>12</strong> And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,  <strong>13</strong> Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.  <strong>14</strong> And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.  <strong>15</strong> And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.  <strong>16</strong> And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.  <strong>17</strong> And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.  <strong>18</strong> And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.  <strong>20</strong> And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.  <strong>21</strong> And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.  <strong>22</strong> And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.  <strong>23</strong> And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.  <strong>24</strong> And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.  <strong>25</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and  slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.  <strong>26</strong> And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.  <strong>27</strong> And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.  <strong>28</strong> Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.  <strong>29</strong> Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.  <strong>30</strong> And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.  <strong>31</strong> But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.  <strong>32</strong> In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;  <strong>33</strong> From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.  <strong>34</strong> Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?  <strong>35</strong> And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.  <strong>36</strong> And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was  twenty and eight years.

Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and declared, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'I anoint you king over the LORD's people Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the LORD's servants shed by Jezebel. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The whole house of Ahab will perish.

These were born to David in Hebron.  <strong>6</strong> And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.  <strong>7</strong> And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?  <strong>8</strong> Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ish-bosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?  <strong>9</strong> So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him;  <strong>10</strong> To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beer-sheba.  <strong>11</strong> And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.  <strong>12</strong> And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.  <strong>13</strong> And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.  <strong>14</strong> And David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.  <strong>15</strong> And Ish-bosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.  <strong>16</strong> And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.  <strong>17</strong> And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:  <strong>18</strong> Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.  <strong>19</strong> And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.  <strong>20</strong> So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.  <strong>21</strong> And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.  <strong>22</strong> And, Behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing  a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was  not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.  <strong>23</strong> When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.  <strong>24</strong> Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?  <strong>25</strong> Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.  <strong>26</strong> And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it  not.  <strong>27</strong> And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib,  that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.  <strong>28</strong> And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:  <strong>29</strong> Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.  <strong>30</strong> So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.  <strong>31</strong> And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.  <strong>32</strong> And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.  <strong>33</strong> And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?  <strong>34</strong> Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.  <strong>35</strong> And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.  <strong>36</strong> And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.  <strong>37</strong> For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.  <strong>38</strong> And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?  <strong>39</strong> And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Sons were born to David in Hebron: His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and the sixth, Ithream the son of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, \"Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, \"Am I a dog's head-on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman! <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, \"Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Good,\" said David. \"I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you: Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, \"Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, \"Go back home!\" So he went back. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, \"For some time you have wanted to make David your king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Now do it! For the LORD promised David, 'By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin wanted to do. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Abner said to David, \"Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a compact with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires.\" So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So Joab went to the king and said, \"What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway, as though to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Later, when David heard about this, he said, \"I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> May his blood fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house! May Joab's house never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> (Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, \"Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner.\" King David himself walked behind the bier. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept also. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The king sang this lament for Abner: \"Should Abner have died as the lawless die? <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before wicked men.\" And all the people wept over him again. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> So on that day all the people and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the king said to his men, \"Do you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel this day? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!\" "}]}
