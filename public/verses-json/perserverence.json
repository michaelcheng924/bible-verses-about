For what son is not disciplined by his father? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Make level paths for your feet,\" so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
