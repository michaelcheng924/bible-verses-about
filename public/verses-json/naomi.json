And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.  <strong>16</strong> And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art  thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.  <strong>17</strong> And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.  <strong>18</strong> Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> One day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, \"My daughter, should I not try to find a home for you, where you will be well provided for? <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been, a kinsman of ours? Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Wash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"I will do whatever you say,\" Ruth answered. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Who are you?\" he asked. \"I am your servant Ruth,\" she said. \"Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a kinsman-redeemer.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"The LORD bless you, my daughter,\" he replied. \"This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to redeem, good; let him redeem. But if he is not willing, as surely as the LORD lives I will do it. Lie here until morning.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, \"Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He also said, \"Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.\" When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her. Then he went back to town. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, \"How did it go, my daughter?\" Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> and added, \"He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then Naomi said, \"Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens.

And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.  <strong>3</strong> And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.  <strong>4</strong> And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.  <strong>5</strong> Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?  <strong>6</strong> And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:  <strong>7</strong> And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house.  <strong>8</strong> Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens:  <strong>9</strong> Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that  which the young men have drawn.  <strong>10</strong> Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?  <strong>11</strong> And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.  <strong>12</strong> The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.  <strong>13</strong> Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.  <strong>14</strong> And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.  <strong>15</strong> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:  <strong>16</strong> And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.  <strong>17</strong> So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.  <strong>18</strong> And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.  <strong>19</strong> And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.  <strong>20</strong> And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen.  <strong>21</strong> And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.  <strong>22</strong> And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field.  <strong>23</strong> So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, a man of standing, whose name was Boaz. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, \"Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.\" Naomi said to her, \"Go ahead, my daughter.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, \"The LORD be with you!The LORD bless you!\" they called back. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, \"Whose young woman is that?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The foreman replied, \"She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So Boaz said to Ruth, \"My daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, \"Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me-a foreigner?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Boaz replied, \"I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband-how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,\" she said. \"You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant-though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> At mealtime Boaz said to her, \"Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.\" When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, \"Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Her mother-in-law asked her, \"Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!\" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. \"The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,\" she said. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"The LORD bless him!\" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. \"He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.\" She added, \"That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Ruth the Moabitess said, \"He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, \"It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with his girls, because in someone else's field you might be harmed.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
