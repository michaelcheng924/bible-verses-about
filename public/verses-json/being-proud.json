He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.  <strong>24</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  <strong>25</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.  <strong>26</strong> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;  <strong>27</strong> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.  <strong>28</strong> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,  <strong>29</strong> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.  <strong>30</strong> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.  <strong>31</strong> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. <strong>32</strong>           There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  <strong>33</strong> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.  <strong>34</strong> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.  <strong>35</strong> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. <strong>36</strong>           But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.  <strong>37</strong> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.  <strong>38</strong> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. <strong>39</strong>           Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  <strong>40</strong> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.  <strong>41</strong> I receive not honour from men.  <strong>42</strong> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.  <strong>43</strong> I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.  <strong>44</strong> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?  <strong>45</strong> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.  <strong>46</strong> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.  <strong>47</strong> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, \"Do you want to get well?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the invalid replied, \"I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to him, \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \"It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But he replied, \"The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus gave them this answer: \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> yet you refuse to come to me to have life. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"I do not accept praise from men, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> but I know you.

It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, \"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.\" "},{"_id":"61592417cd920c662dfffcfb","topicId":"61592411cd920c662dfffce8","verse":"2 Peter 2:9","votes":8,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p61002009_01-22\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v61002009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>9</strong> The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:  ","niv":"<sup><strong>9</strong></sup> if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment."},{"_id":"61592417cd920c662dfffcfc","topicId":"61592411cd920c662dfffce8","verse":"1 John 4:1","votes":8,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p62004001_04-23\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v62004001-1\">4:1&nbsp;</b>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
