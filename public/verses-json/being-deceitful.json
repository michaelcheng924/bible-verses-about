He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This calls for wisdom.
