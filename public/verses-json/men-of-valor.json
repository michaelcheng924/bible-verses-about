But he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled in the direction of the wilderness. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel.

And at sunset Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree and threw it at the entrance of the gate of the city and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p06008029_09-2\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>At that time Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, “an altar of uncut stones, upon which no man has wielded an iron tool.” And they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And all Israel, sojourner as well as native born, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, to bless the people of Israel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06008035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:  <strong>2</strong> And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.  <strong>3</strong> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.  <strong>4</strong> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:  <strong>5</strong> And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,  <strong>6</strong> (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.  <strong>7</strong> Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.  <strong>8</strong> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.  <strong>9</strong> Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.  <strong>10</strong> And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  <strong>11</strong> And all the people, even the people of war that were  with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.  <strong>12</strong> And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.  <strong>13</strong> And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.  <strong>16</strong> And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.  <strong>17</strong> And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is  in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.  <strong>19</strong> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.  <strong>20</strong> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.  <strong>21</strong> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.  <strong>22</strong> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.  <strong>23</strong> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.  <strong>24</strong> And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.  <strong>25</strong> And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.  <strong>26</strong> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  <strong>27</strong> Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.  <strong>28</strong> And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.  <strong>29</strong> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,  <strong>31</strong> As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.  <strong>32</strong> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  <strong>33</strong> And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.  <strong>34</strong> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  <strong>35</strong> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> with these orders: \"Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don't go very far from it. All of you be on the alert. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are running away from us as they did before.' So when we flee from them, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The LORD your God will give it into your hand. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the LORD has commanded. See to it; you have my orders.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai-but Joshua spent that night with the people. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They had the soldiers take up their positions-all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the desert. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city.\" So Joshua held out his javelin toward Ai. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction, for the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men of the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Twelve thousand men and women fell that day-all the people of Ai. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the LORD had instructed Joshua. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He hung the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses-an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the LORD burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua copied on stones the law of Moses, which he had written. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> All Israel, aliens and citizens alike, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD, facing those who carried it-the priests, who were Levites. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law-the blessings and the curses-just as it is written in the Book of the Law. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the aliens who lived among them.

What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" ","modified":"2022-10-04T16:17:06.392Z"},{"_id":"61679e71a3a86b670bc2ffc5","topicId":"61679e6ea3a86b670bc2ffb9","verse":"Romans 13:1-14","votes":14,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p45013001_05-15\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v45013001-1\">13:1&nbsp;</b>Let every person be subject to the governing authorities.
