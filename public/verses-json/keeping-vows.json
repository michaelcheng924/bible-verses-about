His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Gilead's wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown up, they drove Jephthah away. \"You are not going to get any inheritance in our family,\" they said, \"because you are the son of another woman.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a group of adventurers gathered around him and followed him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some time later, when the Ammonites made war on Israel, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Come,\" they said, \"be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jephthah said to them, \"Didn't you hate me and drive me from my father's house? Why do you come to me now, when you're in trouble?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The elders of Gilead said to him, \"Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be our head over all who live in Gilead.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Jephthah answered, \"Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me-will I really be your head?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The elders of Gilead replied, \"The LORD is our witness; we will certainly do as you say.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the LORD in Mizpah. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: \"What do you have against us that you have attacked our country?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah's messengers, \"When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> saying: \"This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But when they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the desert to the Red Sea and on to Kadesh. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Give us permission to go through your country,' but the king of Edom would not listen. They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Next they traveled through the desert, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, 'Let us pass through your country to our own place.' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Sihon, however, did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. He mustered all his men and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Then the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his men into Israel's hands, and they defeated them. Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the LORD our God has given us, we will possess. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Are you better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon. Why didn't you retake them during that time? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the LORD, the Judge, decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD: \"If you give the Ammonites into my hands, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the LORD 's, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into his hands. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of tambourines! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, \"Oh! My daughter! You have made me miserable and wretched, because I have made a vow to the LORD that I cannot break.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"My father,\" she replied, \"you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me just as you promised, now that the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But grant me this one request,\" she said. \"Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You may go,\" he said. And he let her go for two months. She and the girls went into the hills and wept because she would never marry. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> After the two months, she returned to her father and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite custom <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.

And she said, Yea, for so much.  <strong>9</strong> Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.  <strong>10</strong> Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her  forth, buried her by her husband.  <strong>11</strong> And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.  <strong>12</strong> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.  <strong>13</strong> And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.  <strong>14</strong> And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)  <strong>15</strong> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.  <strong>16</strong> There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.  <strong>17</strong> Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,  <strong>18</strong> And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.  <strong>19</strong> But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,  <strong>20</strong> Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.  <strong>21</strong> And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.

And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Peter asked her, \"Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?Yes,\" she said, \"that is the price.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Peter said to her, \"How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord?

Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon's Colonnade. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and all of them were healed. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Go, stand in the temple courts,\" he said, \"and tell the people the full message of this new life.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin--the full assembly of the elders of Israel--and sent to the jail for the apostles. But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled, wondering what would come of this. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then someone came and said, \"Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\" he said. \"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Peter and the other apostles replied: \"We must obey God rather than men! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead--whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then he addressed them: \"Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.

And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?  <strong>9</strong> And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,  <strong>10</strong> And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were  beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.  <strong>11</strong> Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.  <strong>12</strong> This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:  <strong>13</strong> And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.  <strong>14</strong> And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel  at the mouth of the LORD.  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.  <strong>17</strong> And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.  <strong>18</strong> And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.  <strong>19</strong> But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.  <strong>20</strong> This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.  <strong>21</strong> And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.  <strong>22</strong> And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?  <strong>23</strong> Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.  <strong>24</strong> And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  <strong>25</strong> And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.  <strong>26</strong> And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.  <strong>27</strong> And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things-those in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> they came together to make war against Joshua and Israel. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> they resorted to a ruse: They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The men put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, \"We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The men of Israel said to the Hivites, \"But perhaps you live near us. How then can we make a treaty with you?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"We are your servants,\" they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, \"Who are you and where do you come from?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They answered: \"Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard reports of him: all that he did in Egypt, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan-Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, 'Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, \"We are your servants; make a treaty with us.\"' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> but all the leaders answered, \"We have given them our oath by the LORD, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> This is what we will do to them: We will let them live, so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They continued, \"Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community.\" So the leaders' promise to them was kept. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, \"Why did you deceive us by saying, 'We live a long way from you,' while actually you live near us? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You are now under a curse: You will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They answered Joshua, \"Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the LORD at the place the LORD would choose. And that is what they are to this day.
