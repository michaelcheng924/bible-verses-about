Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So there was great joy in that city. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria.

This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The Spirit told Philip, \"Go to that chariot and stay near it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: \"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \"Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
