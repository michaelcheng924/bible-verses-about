And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.  <strong>3</strong> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.  <strong>4</strong> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:  <strong>5</strong> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.  <strong>6</strong> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,  <strong>7</strong> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.  <strong>8</strong> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.  <strong>9</strong> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  <strong>10</strong> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  <strong>11</strong> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  <strong>12</strong> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:  <strong>13</strong> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.  <strong>14</strong> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.  <strong>15</strong> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  <strong>16</strong> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  <strong>18</strong> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:  <strong>19</strong> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:  <strong>20</strong> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.  <strong>21</strong> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.  <strong>22</strong> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  <strong>23</strong> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.  <strong>24</strong> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;  <strong>25</strong> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  <strong>28</strong> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  <strong>30</strong> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.  <strong>31</strong> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:  <strong>32</strong> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>33</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>34</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>35</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>36</strong> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.  <strong>37</strong> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.  <strong>38</strong> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"My lords,\" he said, \"please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.No,\" they answered, \"we will spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-both young and old-surrounded the house. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They called to Lot, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and said, \"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Get out of our way,\" they replied. And they said, \"This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them.\" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The two men said to Lot, \"Do you have anyone else here-sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, \"Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!\" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, \"Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Lot said to them, \"No, my lords, please! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it-it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to him, \"Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.\" (That is why the town was called Zoar. ) <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from the LORD out of the heavens. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities-and also the vegetation in the land. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.

Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.  <strong>6</strong> And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.  <strong>7</strong> And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.  <strong>8</strong> And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.  <strong>9</strong> So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was  with him.  <strong>10</strong> These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.  <strong>11</strong> And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.  <strong>12</strong> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.  <strong>13</strong> He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.  <strong>14</strong> And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them  by a great deliverance.  <strong>15</strong> Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.  <strong>16</strong> And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison was then at Bethlehem.  <strong>17</strong> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!  <strong>18</strong> And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD,  <strong>19</strong> And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.  <strong>20</strong> And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.  <strong>21</strong> Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.  <strong>22</strong> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.  <strong>23</strong> And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.  <strong>24</strong> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.  <strong>25</strong> Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.  <strong>26</strong> Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  <strong>27</strong> Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,  <strong>28</strong> Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi-ezer the Antothite,  <strong>29</strong> Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,  <strong>30</strong> Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,  <strong>31</strong> Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,  <strong>32</strong> Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,  <strong>33</strong> Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,  <strong>34</strong> The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,  <strong>35</strong> Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,  <strong>36</strong> Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,  <strong>37</strong> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,  <strong>38</strong> Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,  <strong>39</strong> Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,  <strong>40</strong> Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,  <strong>41</strong> Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,  <strong>42</strong> Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,  <strong>43</strong> Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,  <strong>44</strong> Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,  <strong>45</strong> Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,  <strong>46</strong> Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,  <strong>47</strong> Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.  <strong>1</strong> Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were  among the mighty men, helpers of the war.  <strong>2</strong> They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.  <strong>3</strong> The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite;

 <strong>9</strong> Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,  <strong>10</strong> Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,  <strong>11</strong> Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,  <strong>12</strong> Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,  <strong>13</strong> Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.  <strong>14</strong> These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.  <strong>15</strong> These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them  of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.  <strong>16</strong> And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.  <strong>17</strong> And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is  no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon,  and rebuke it.  <strong>18</strong> Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.  <strong>19</strong> And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.  <strong>20</strong> As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.  <strong>21</strong> And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.  <strong>22</strong> For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.  <strong>23</strong> And these are the numbers of the bands that were  ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.  <strong>24</strong> The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.  <strong>25</strong> Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.  <strong>26</strong> Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.  <strong>27</strong> And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;  <strong>28</strong> And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty and two captains.  <strong>29</strong> And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.  <strong>30</strong> And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.  <strong>31</strong> And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.  <strong>32</strong> And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.  <strong>33</strong> Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were  not of double heart.  <strong>34</strong> And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.  <strong>35</strong> And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.  <strong>36</strong> And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.  <strong>37</strong> And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.  <strong>38</strong> All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.  <strong>39</strong> And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.  <strong>40</strong> Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.  <strong>1</strong> And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.  <strong>2</strong> And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem  good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:  <strong>3</strong> And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.  <strong>4</strong> And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.  <strong>5</strong> So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.  <strong>6</strong> And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.  <strong>7</strong> And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.  <strong>8</strong> And David and all Israel played before God with all their  might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.  <strong>9</strong> And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.  <strong>10</strong> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.  <strong>11</strong> And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.  <strong>12</strong> And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?  <strong>13</strong> So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.  <strong>14</strong> And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.  <strong>1</strong> Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.  <strong>2</strong> And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.  <strong>3</strong> And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.  <strong>4</strong> Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,  <strong>5</strong> And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,  <strong>6</strong> And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,  <strong>7</strong> And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.  <strong>8</strong> And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.  <strong>9</strong> And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.  <strong>10</strong> And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.  <strong>11</strong> So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.  <strong>12</strong> And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.  <strong>13</strong> And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.  <strong>15</strong> And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.  <strong>16</strong> David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.  <strong>17</strong> And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, \"We are your own flesh and blood. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through Samuel. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> said to David, \"You will not get in here.\" Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> David had said, \"Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.\" Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> These were the chiefs of David's mighty men-they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised- <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> this is the list of David's mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.

The people of Aram will go into exile to Kir,\" says the LORD. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Gaza, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she took captive whole communities and sold them to Edom, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I will send fire upon the walls of Gaza that will consume her fortresses. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I will destroy the king of Ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in Ashkelon. I will turn my hand against Ekron, till the last of the Philistines is dead,\" says the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Tyre, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because she sold whole communities of captives to Edom, disregarding a treaty of brotherhood, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I will send fire upon the walls of Tyre that will consume her fortresses.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not turn back my wrath. Because he pursued his brother with a sword, stifling all compassion, because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will send fire upon Teman that will consume the fortresses of Bozrah.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"For three sins of Ammon, even for four, I will not turn back {my wrath}. Because he ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to extend his borders, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle, amid violent winds on a stormy day. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Her king will go into exile, he and his officials together,\" says the LORD.
