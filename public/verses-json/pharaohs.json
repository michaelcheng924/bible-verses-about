And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.  <strong>9</strong> And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;  <strong>10</strong> And in the vine were three branches: and it was  as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:  <strong>11</strong> And Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.  <strong>12</strong> And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days:  <strong>13</strong> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.  <strong>14</strong> But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:  <strong>15</strong> For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.  <strong>16</strong> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:  <strong>17</strong> And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.  <strong>18</strong> And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days:  <strong>19</strong> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.  <strong>20</strong> And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.  <strong>21</strong> And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand:  <strong>22</strong> But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.  <strong>23</strong> Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.  <strong>2</strong> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.  <strong>3</strong> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.  <strong>4</strong> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.  <strong>5</strong> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.  <strong>6</strong> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.  <strong>7</strong> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.  <strong>9</strong> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:  <strong>10</strong> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker:  <strong>11</strong> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.  <strong>12</strong> And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.  <strong>13</strong> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.  <strong>14</strong> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.  <strong>15</strong> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is  none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that  thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.  <strong>16</strong> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.  <strong>17</strong> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:  <strong>18</strong> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:  <strong>19</strong> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:  <strong>20</strong> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:  <strong>21</strong> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.  <strong>22</strong> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:  <strong>23</strong> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:  <strong>24</strong> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this  unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.  <strong>25</strong> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.  <strong>26</strong> The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.  <strong>27</strong> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.  <strong>28</strong> This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.  <strong>29</strong> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:  <strong>30</strong> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;  <strong>31</strong> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.  <strong>32</strong> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is  because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.  <strong>33</strong> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.  <strong>34</strong> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.  <strong>35</strong> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> each of the two men-the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison-had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him in his master's house, \"Why are your faces so sad today?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"We both had dreams,\" they answered, \"but there is no one to interpret them.\" Then Joseph said to them, \"Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, \"In my dream I saw a vine in front of me, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup and put the cup in his hand.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"This is what it means,\" Joseph said to him. \"The three branches are three days. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, \"I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"This is what it means,\" Joseph said. \"The three baskets are three days. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat away your flesh.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh's hand, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph;

The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;  <strong>20</strong> The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.  <strong>21</strong> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.  <strong>22</strong> And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.  <strong>23</strong> And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.  <strong>24</strong> And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.  <strong>25</strong> And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.  <strong>27</strong> And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, \"Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He who was seated on the throne said, \"I am making everything new!\" Then he said, \"Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said to me: \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, \"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits thick, by man's measurement, which the angel was using. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
