In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?  <strong>5</strong> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>6</strong> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  <strong>7</strong> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  <strong>8</strong> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  <strong>9</strong> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?  <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  <strong>11</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.  <strong>12</strong> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"6168e253803fbb813a709f74","topicId":"6168e251803fbb813a709f6d","verse":"Revelation 13:1","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p66013001_04-7\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v66013001-1\">13:1&nbsp;</b>And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

which are offered by the law;  <strong>9</strong> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.  <strong>10</strong> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  <strong>11</strong> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  <strong>12</strong> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;  <strong>13</strong> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  <strong>14</strong> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  <strong>15</strong> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,  <strong>16</strong> This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  <strong>17</strong> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  <strong>18</strong> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.  <strong>19</strong> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,  <strong>20</strong> By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;  <strong>21</strong> And having an high priest over the house of God;  <strong>22</strong> Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.  <strong>23</strong> Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)  <strong>24</strong> And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:  <strong>25</strong> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  <strong>26</strong> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  <strong>27</strong> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.  <strong>28</strong> He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:  <strong>29</strong> Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?  <strong>30</strong> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.  <strong>31</strong> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  <strong>32</strong> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  <strong>33</strong> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  <strong>34</strong> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.  <strong>35</strong> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  <strong>36</strong> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  <strong>37</strong> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  <strong>38</strong> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  <strong>39</strong> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: \"Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll--I have come to do your will, O God.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> First he said, \"Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them\" (although the law required them to be made). <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then he said, \"Here I am, I have come to do your will.\" He sets aside the first to establish the second. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then he adds: \"Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and since we have a great priest over the house of God, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For we know him who said, \"It is mine to avenge; I will repay,\" and again, \"The Lord will judge his people.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> For in just a very little while, \"He who is coming will come and will not delay. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.

Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.  <strong>12</strong> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.  <strong>14</strong> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.  <strong>15</strong> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.  <strong>16</strong> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,  <strong>17</strong> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.  <strong>18</strong> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.  <strong>19</strong> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.  <strong>20</strong> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.  <strong>21</strong> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.  <strong>22</strong> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;  <strong>23</strong> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)  <strong>24</strong> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.  <strong>25</strong> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.  <strong>27</strong> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  <strong>28</strong> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  <strong>29</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  <strong>30</strong> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  <strong>31</strong> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  <strong>33</strong> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.  <strong>34</strong> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  <strong>36</strong> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.  <strong>37</strong> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  <strong>38</strong> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.  <strong>39</strong> And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.  <strong>40</strong> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>41</strong> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.  <strong>42</strong> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?  <strong>43</strong> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.  <strong>44</strong> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>45</strong> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.  <strong>47</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.  <strong>48</strong> I am that bread of life.  <strong>49</strong> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  <strong>50</strong> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.  <strong>51</strong> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.  <strong>52</strong> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  <strong>53</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.  <strong>54</strong> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>55</strong> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.  <strong>56</strong> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.  <strong>57</strong> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.  <strong>58</strong> This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.  <strong>59</strong> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.  <strong>60</strong> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,  said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  <strong>61</strong> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?  <strong>62</strong> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  <strong>63</strong> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.  <strong>64</strong> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.  <strong>65</strong> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. <strong>66</strong> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  <strong>67</strong> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  <strong>68</strong> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.  <strong>69</strong> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>70</strong> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?  <strong>71</strong> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Jewish Passover Feast was near. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Philip answered him, \"Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"from now on give us this bread.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> I am the bread of life. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve?

And he arose and stood forth.  <strong>9</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?  <strong>10</strong> And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.  <strong>11</strong> And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.  <strong>12</strong> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.  <strong>13</strong> And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;  <strong>14</strong> Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,  <strong>15</strong> Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,  <strong>16</strong> And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.  <strong>17</strong> And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;  <strong>18</strong> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.  <strong>19</strong> And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.  <strong>20</strong> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.  <strong>21</strong> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  <strong>22</strong> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.  <strong>23</strong> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.  <strong>24</strong> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.  <strong>25</strong> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger.

Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And this was his message: \"After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And a voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"The time has come,\" he said. \"The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> At once they left their nets and followed him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Be quiet!\" said Jesus sternly. \"Come out of him!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \"What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The whole town gathered at the door, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Simon and his companions went to look for him, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and when they found him, they exclaimed: \"Everyone is looking for you!\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
