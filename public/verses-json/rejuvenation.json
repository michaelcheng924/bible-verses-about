When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground- <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground-trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And the LORD God commanded the man, \"You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The LORD God said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The man said, \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman, 'for she was taken out of man.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

 <strong>21</strong> Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD.  <strong>1</strong> The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and  with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars;  <strong>2</strong> Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills.  <strong>3</strong> O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance and  all thy treasures to the spoil, and thy high places for sin, throughout all thy borders.  <strong>4</strong> And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.  <strong>5</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD.  <strong>6</strong> For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in  a salt land and not inhabited.  <strong>7</strong> Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.  <strong>8</strong> For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that  spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.  <strong>9</strong> The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?  <strong>10</strong> I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.  <strong>11</strong> As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them  not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.  <strong>12</strong> A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.  <strong>13</strong> O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.  <strong>14</strong> Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise.  <strong>15</strong> Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.  <strong>16</strong> As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out of my lips was right before thee.  <strong>17</strong> Be not a terror unto me: thou art my hope in the day of evil.  <strong>18</strong> Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.  <strong>19</strong> Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;  <strong>20</strong> And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:  <strong>21</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;  <strong>22</strong> Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.  <strong>23</strong> But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.  <strong>24</strong> And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;  <strong>25</strong> Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.  <strong>1</strong> The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.  <strong>3</strong> Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.  <strong>4</strong> And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.  <strong>5</strong> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,  <strong>6</strong> O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;  <strong>8</strong> If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.  <strong>9</strong> And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;  <strong>10</strong> If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.  <strong>11</strong> Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.  <strong>12</strong> And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.  <strong>14</strong> Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh  from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?  <strong>15</strong> Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;  <strong>16</strong> To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.  <strong>17</strong> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.  <strong>18</strong> Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.  <strong>19</strong> Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.  <strong>20</strong> Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and  to turn away thy wrath from them.  <strong>21</strong> Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.  <strong>22</strong> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.  <strong>23</strong> Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:  forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"But now I will send for many fishermen,\" declares the LORD, \"and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.\" "},{"_id":"616a2bafa03c6e96020b96ff","topicId":"616a2baaa03c6e96020b96f2","verse":"Joshua 1:9","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p06001009_01-15\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v06001009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Have I not commanded you?
