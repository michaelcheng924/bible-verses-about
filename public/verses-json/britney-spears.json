feet abide not in her house:  <strong>12</strong> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)  <strong>13</strong> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,  <strong>14</strong> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  <strong>16</strong> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,  with fine linen of Egypt.  <strong>17</strong> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  <strong>18</strong> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.  <strong>19</strong> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:  <strong>20</strong> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.  <strong>21</strong> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.  <strong>22</strong> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;  <strong>23</strong> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.  <strong>24</strong> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my
