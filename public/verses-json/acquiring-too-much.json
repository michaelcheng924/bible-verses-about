understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.  <strong>35</strong> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.  <strong>36</strong> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.  <strong>37</strong> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.  <strong>38</strong> Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.  <strong>39</strong> Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are  good.  <strong>40</strong> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.  <strong>41</strong> Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.  <strong>42</strong> So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.  <strong>43</strong> And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.  <strong>44</strong> So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.  <strong>45</strong> And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.  <strong>46</strong> I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.  <strong>47</strong> And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.  <strong>48</strong> My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.  <strong>49</strong> Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.  <strong>50</strong> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.  <strong>51</strong> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.  <strong>52</strong> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.  <strong>53</strong> Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.  <strong>54</strong> Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.  <strong>55</strong> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.  <strong>56</strong> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  <strong>57</strong>             Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.  <strong>58</strong> I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.  <strong>59</strong> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.  <strong>60</strong> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.  <strong>61</strong> The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.  <strong>62</strong> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>63</strong> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.  <strong>64</strong> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>65</strong> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>66</strong> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.  <strong>67</strong> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.  <strong>68</strong> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.  <strong>69</strong> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  <strong>70</strong> Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.  <strong>71</strong>             It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.  <strong>72</strong> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.  <strong>73</strong> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  <strong>74</strong> They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.  <strong>75</strong> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  <strong>76</strong> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.  <strong>77</strong> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.  <strong>78</strong> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.  <strong>79</strong> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.  <strong>80</strong> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.  <strong>81</strong> My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.  <strong>82</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?  <strong>83</strong> For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.  <strong>84</strong> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  <strong>85</strong> The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.  <strong>86</strong> All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.  <strong>87</strong> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.  <strong>88</strong> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  <strong>89</strong> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.  <strong>90</strong> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.  <strong>91</strong> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.  <strong>92</strong> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.  <strong>93</strong> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.  <strong>94</strong> I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.  <strong>95</strong> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.  <strong>96</strong> I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.  <strong>97</strong> O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.  <strong>98</strong> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.  <strong>99</strong> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.  <strong>100</strong> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.  <strong>101</strong> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  <strong>102</strong> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.  <strong>103</strong> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!  <strong>104</strong> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  <strong>105</strong> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  <strong>106</strong> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  <strong>107</strong> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>108</strong> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  <strong>109</strong> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.  <strong>110</strong> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.  <strong>111</strong> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  <strong>112</strong> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.  <strong>113</strong> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.  <strong>114</strong> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.  <strong>115</strong> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.  <strong>116</strong> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  <strong>117</strong> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  <strong>118</strong> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.  <strong>119</strong> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.  <strong>120</strong> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  <strong>121</strong> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.  <strong>122</strong> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.  <strong>123</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.  <strong>124</strong> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>125</strong> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.  <strong>126</strong>             It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for  they have made void thy law.  <strong>127</strong> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.  <strong>128</strong> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning  all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  <strong>129</strong> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.  <strong>130</strong> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.  <strong>131</strong> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.  <strong>132</strong> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  <strong>133</strong> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  <strong>134</strong> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.  <strong>135</strong> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>136</strong> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  <strong>137</strong> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.  <strong>138</strong> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  <strong>139</strong> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  <strong>140</strong> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.  <strong>141</strong> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.  <strong>142</strong> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.  <strong>143</strong> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.  <strong>144</strong> The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.  <strong>145</strong> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.  <strong>146</strong> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  <strong>147</strong> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.  <strong>148</strong> Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  <strong>149</strong> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  <strong>150</strong> They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.  <strong>151</strong> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are  truth.  <strong>152</strong> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.  <strong>153</strong> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.  <strong>154</strong> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.  <strong>155</strong> Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.  <strong>156</strong> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.  <strong>157</strong> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet  do I not decline from thy testimonies.  <strong>158</strong> I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.  <strong>159</strong> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.  <strong>160</strong> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  <strong>161</strong> Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.  <strong>162</strong> I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.  <strong>163</strong> I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.  <strong>164</strong> Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>165</strong> Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.

kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.  <strong>169</strong> Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.
