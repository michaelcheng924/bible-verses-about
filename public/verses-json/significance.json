And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.  <strong>7</strong> And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.  <strong>8</strong> And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.  <strong>9</strong> And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  <strong>11</strong> And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but  the LORD was not in the earthquake:  <strong>12</strong> And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was  not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.  <strong>13</strong> And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?  <strong>14</strong> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  <strong>15</strong> And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:  <strong>16</strong> And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.  <strong>18</strong> Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.  <strong>19</strong> So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.  <strong>20</strong> And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?  <strong>21</strong> And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, \"May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. \"I have had enough, LORD,\" he said. \"Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, \"Get up and eat.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, \"Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD said, \"Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.\" Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The LORD said to him, \"Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel-all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. \"Let me kiss my father and mother good-by,\" he said, \"and then I will come with you.Go back,\" Elijah replied. \"What have I done to you?\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.
