Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power.  <strong>2</strong> Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his excellent greatness.  <strong>3</strong> Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the psaltery and harp.  <strong>4</strong> Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and organs.  <strong>5</strong> Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high sounding cymbals.  <strong>6</strong> Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye the LORD.
