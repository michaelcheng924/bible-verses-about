One goes hungry, another gets drunk. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in?

What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory?

One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.

<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be

calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red

He must be holy until the period of his separation to the LORD is over; he must let the hair of his head grow long. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Throughout the period of his separation to the LORD he must not go near a dead body. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Even if his own father or mother or brother or sister dies, he must not make himself ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol of his separation to God is on his head. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Throughout the period of his separation he is consecrated to the LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'If someone dies suddenly in his presence, thus defiling the hair he has dedicated, he must shave his head on the day of his cleansing-the seventh day. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then on the eighth day he must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for him because he sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day he is to consecrate his head. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He must dedicate himself to the LORD for the period of his separation and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count, because he became defiled during his separation. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"'Now this is the law for the Nazirite when the period of his separation is over. He is to be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> There he is to present his offerings to the LORD: a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made without yeast-cakes made of fine flour mixed with oil, and wafers spread with oil. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"'The priest is to present them before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the LORD, together with its grain offering and drink offering. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"'Then at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the hair that he dedicated. He is to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"'After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair of his dedication, the priest is to place in his hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and a cake and a wafer from the basket, both made without yeast. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The priest shall then wave them before the LORD as a wave offering; they are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented.
