It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For we know in part and we prophesy in part, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
