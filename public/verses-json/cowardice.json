I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.

If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

Jesus saith unto them, I amhe. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.  <strong>6</strong> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.  <strong>7</strong> Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye?

Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.  <strong>17</strong> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.  <strong>18</strong> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.  <strong>19</strong> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.  <strong>20</strong> Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.  <strong>21</strong> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.  <strong>22</strong> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?  <strong>23</strong> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?  <strong>24</strong> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.  <strong>25</strong> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it,  and said, I am not.  <strong>26</strong> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?  <strong>27</strong> Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.  <strong>28</strong> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.  <strong>29</strong> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?  <strong>30</strong> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:  <strong>32</strong> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>33</strong> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?  <strong>35</strong> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  <strong>36</strong> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.  <strong>37</strong> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.  <strong>38</strong> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.  <strong>39</strong> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  <strong>40</strong> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.  <strong>1</strong> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.  <strong>2</strong> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,  <strong>3</strong> And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.  <strong>4</strong> Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.  <strong>5</strong> Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!  <strong>6</strong> When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.  <strong>7</strong> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.  <strong>8</strong> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;  <strong>9</strong> And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.  <strong>10</strong> Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?  <strong>11</strong> Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.  <strong>12</strong> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.  <strong>13</strong> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.  <strong>14</strong> And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!  <strong>15</strong> But they cried out, Away with him, away with him,  crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.  <strong>16</strong> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.  <strong>17</strong> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place  of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:  <strong>18</strong> Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.  <strong>19</strong> And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>20</strong> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and  Greek, and Latin.  <strong>21</strong> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.  <strong>22</strong> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.  <strong>23</strong> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.  <strong>24</strong> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.  <strong>25</strong> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.  <strong>26</strong> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!  <strong>27</strong> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.  <strong>28</strong> After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.  <strong>29</strong> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.  <strong>30</strong> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.  <strong>31</strong> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that  they might be taken away.  <strong>32</strong> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.  <strong>33</strong> But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:  <strong>34</strong> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.  <strong>35</strong> And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.  <strong>36</strong> For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.  <strong>37</strong> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.  <strong>38</strong> And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.  <strong>39</strong> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.  <strong>40</strong> Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.  <strong>41</strong> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.  <strong>42</strong> There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I am he,\" Jesus said.
