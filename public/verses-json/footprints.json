together, that they cannot be sundered.  <strong>18</strong> By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.  <strong>19</strong> Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.  <strong>20</strong> Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.  <strong>21</strong> His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of

they cannot be moved.  <strong>24</strong> His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.  <strong>25</strong> When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.  <strong>26</strong> The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.  <strong>27</strong> He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.  <strong>28</strong> The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.  <strong>29</strong> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.  <strong>30</strong> Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.  <strong>31</strong> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.  <strong>32</strong> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.  <strong>33</strong> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
