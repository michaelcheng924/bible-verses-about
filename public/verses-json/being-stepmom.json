And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.  <strong>12</strong> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;  <strong>14</strong> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.  <strong>15</strong> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.  <strong>16</strong> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me  now: and if not, I will take it by force.  <strong>17</strong> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.  <strong>19</strong> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it  to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <strong>20</strong> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD.

I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?\" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, \"This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you-they will both die on the same day. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, \"Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.\"'\" "},{"_id":"6159130a2053ce65432d857b","topicId":"615913092053ce65432d8576","verse":"Acts 2:38","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p44002038_01-7\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
