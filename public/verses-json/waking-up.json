 <strong>12</strong> Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?  <strong>13</strong> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?  <strong>14</strong> And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.  <strong>15</strong> And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even  thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.  <strong>16</strong> LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God.  <strong>17</strong> Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands,  <strong>18</strong> And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art  the LORD God, even thou only.  <strong>20</strong> Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.  <strong>21</strong> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.  <strong>22</strong> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even  against the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>23</strong> By the messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, and  the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, and into the forest of his Carmel.  <strong>24</strong> I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.  <strong>25</strong> Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and  of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.  <strong>26</strong> Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as  the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.  <strong>27</strong> But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.  <strong>28</strong> Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.  <strong>29</strong> And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.  <strong>30</strong> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.  <strong>31</strong> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.  <strong>32</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.  <strong>33</strong> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.  <strong>34</strong> For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.  <strong>35</strong> And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.  <strong>36</strong> So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.  <strong>37</strong> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They told him, \"This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Isaiah said to them, \"Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard-those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Listen! I am going to put such a spirit in him that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was marching out to fight against him. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word: <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them: the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: \"O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by men's hands. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him: \"'The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By your messengers you have heaped insults on the Lord. And you have said, \"With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest parts, the finest of its forests. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"'Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"'But I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Because you rage against me and your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah: \"This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria: \"He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the LORD. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> That night the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning-there were all the dead bodies! <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  <strong>3</strong> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  <strong>4</strong> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  <strong>5</strong> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  <strong>6</strong> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  <strong>7</strong> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were  under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  <strong>8</strong> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  <strong>9</strong> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  <strong>10</strong> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>11</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>12</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>13</strong> And the evening and the morning were the third day.  <strong>14</strong> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  <strong>15</strong> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>16</strong> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  <strong>17</strong> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  <strong>18</strong> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>19</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  <strong>20</strong> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  <strong>21</strong> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>22</strong> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  <strong>23</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  <strong>24</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  <strong>25</strong> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>26</strong> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  <strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  <strong>28</strong> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  <strong>30</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  <strong>31</strong> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was  very good.
