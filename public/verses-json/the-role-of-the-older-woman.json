my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?  <strong>3</strong> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.  <strong>4</strong> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:  <strong>5</strong> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  <strong>6</strong> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.  <strong>7</strong> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  <strong>8</strong> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.  <strong>9</strong> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.  <strong>10</strong> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.  <strong>11</strong> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.  <strong>12</strong> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.  <strong>13</strong> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.  <strong>14</strong> She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.  <strong>15</strong> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.  <strong>16</strong> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.  <strong>17</strong> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.  <strong>18</strong> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.  <strong>19</strong> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.  <strong>20</strong> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.  <strong>21</strong> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.  <strong>22</strong> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is  silk and purple.  <strong>23</strong> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.  <strong>24</strong> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  <strong>25</strong> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.  <strong>26</strong> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.  <strong>27</strong> She looketh well to the ways of

done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.  <strong>30</strong> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but  a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.  <strong>31</strong> Give her of

She is worth far more than rubies. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.

<strong>17</strong> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.  <strong>18</strong> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.  <strong>19</strong> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.  <strong>20</strong> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.

silk and purple.  <strong>23</strong> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.  <strong>24</strong> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  <strong>25</strong> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.  <strong>26</strong> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.  <strong>27</strong> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.  <strong>28</strong> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,  and he praiseth her.  <strong>29</strong> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.  <strong>30</strong> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but  a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.  <strong>31</strong> Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
