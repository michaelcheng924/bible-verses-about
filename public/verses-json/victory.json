For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.  <strong>7</strong> For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.  <strong>8</strong> A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.  <strong>9</strong> Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:  <strong>10</strong> But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.  <strong>11</strong> For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.  <strong>12</strong> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.  <strong>13</strong> Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:  <strong>14</strong> But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.  <strong>15</strong> Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.  <strong>16</strong> Do not err, my beloved brethren.  <strong>17</strong> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.  <strong>18</strong> Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.  <strong>19</strong> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:  <strong>20</strong> For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.  <strong>21</strong> Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.  <strong>22</strong> But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.  <strong>23</strong> For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:  <strong>24</strong> For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.  <strong>25</strong> But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.  <strong>26</strong> If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.  <strong>27</strong> Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
