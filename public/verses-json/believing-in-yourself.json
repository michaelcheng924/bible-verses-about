write them upon the table of thine heart:  <strong>4</strong> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.  <strong>5</strong> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  <strong>6</strong> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  <strong>7</strong> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.  <strong>8</strong> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.  <strong>9</strong> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:  <strong>10</strong> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.  <strong>11</strong> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD;

and in her left hand riches and honour.  <strong>17</strong> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.  <strong>18</strong> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.  <strong>19</strong> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.  <strong>20</strong> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.  <strong>21</strong> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:  <strong>22</strong> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.  <strong>23</strong> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.  <strong>24</strong> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.  <strong>25</strong> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.  <strong>26</strong> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.  <strong>27</strong> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.  <strong>28</strong> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.  <strong>29</strong> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.  <strong>30</strong> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.  <strong>31</strong> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.  <strong>32</strong> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.  <strong>33</strong> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.  <strong>34</strong> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.  <strong>35</strong> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.  <strong>1</strong> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.  <strong>2</strong> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.  <strong>3</strong> For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.  <strong>4</strong> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.  <strong>5</strong> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not;

and the years of thy life shall be many.  <strong>11</strong> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.  <strong>12</strong> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.  <strong>13</strong> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.  <strong>14</strong> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.  <strong>15</strong> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.  <strong>16</strong> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.  <strong>17</strong> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.  <strong>18</strong> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.  <strong>19</strong> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.  <strong>20</strong> My son, attend to my words;

for out of it are the issues of life.  <strong>24</strong> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.  <strong>25</strong> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.  <strong>26</strong> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.  <strong>27</strong> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.  <strong>1</strong> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:  <strong>2</strong> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.  <strong>3</strong> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:  <strong>4</strong> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.  <strong>5</strong> Her feet go down to death;
