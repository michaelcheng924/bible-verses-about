iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.  <strong>3</strong> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness.  <strong>4</strong> None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.  <strong>5</strong> They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper.  <strong>6</strong> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.  <strong>7</strong> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths.  <strong>8</strong> The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.  <strong>10</strong> We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we had  no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in desolate places as dead men.  <strong>11</strong> We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.  <strong>12</strong> For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for  our iniquities, we know them;  <strong>13</strong> In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.  <strong>14</strong> And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.  <strong>15</strong> Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no judgment.  <strong>16</strong> And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.  <strong>17</strong> For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.  <strong>18</strong> According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.  <strong>19</strong> So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.  <strong>20</strong> And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters wicked things. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments and speak lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark their ways. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks in them will know peace. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like men without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities: <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, fomenting oppression and revolt, uttering lies our hearts have conceived. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm worked salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> From the west, men will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the LORD drives along. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"As for me, this is my covenant with them,\" says the LORD. \"My Spirit, who is on you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth, or from the mouths of your children, or from the mouths of their descendants from this time on and forever,\" says the LORD.
