Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.  <strong>8</strong> But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.  <strong>9</strong> For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.  <strong>10</strong> And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.  <strong>11</strong> For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.  <strong>13</strong> Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.  <strong>14</strong> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.  <strong>15</strong> For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.  <strong>16</strong> If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.  <strong>17</strong> Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <strong>18</strong> For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.  <strong>19</strong> For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.  <strong>20</strong> Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.  <strong>21</strong> I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.  <strong>22</strong> For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:  <strong>23</strong> But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  <strong>24</strong> O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  <strong>25</strong> I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives? <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, \"Do not covet.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For in my inner being I delight in God's law; <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.

<strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"615fc1d9eb63b282e3fc33d1","topicId":"615fc1d3eb63b282e3fc33c2","verse":"Matthew 8:1-10:42","votes":2,"__v":0,"kjv":"<strong>1</strong> When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.  <strong>2</strong> And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <strong>3</strong> And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  <strong>4</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <strong>5</strong> And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,  <strong>6</strong> And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.  <strong>7</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.  <strong>8</strong> The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.  <strong>9</strong> For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  <strong>10</strong> When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.  <strong>11</strong> And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>12</strong> But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>13</strong> And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.  <strong>14</strong> And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.  <strong>15</strong> And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.  <strong>16</strong> When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:  <strong>17</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  <strong>18</strong> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.  <strong>19</strong> And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  <strong>20</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.  <strong>21</strong> And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  <strong>22</strong> But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. <strong>23</strong> And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.  <strong>24</strong> And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.  <strong>25</strong> And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.  <strong>26</strong> And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.  <strong>27</strong> But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!  <strong>28</strong> And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.  <strong>29</strong> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?  <strong>30</strong> And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.  <strong>31</strong> So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.  <strong>32</strong> And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.  <strong>33</strong> And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.  <strong>34</strong> And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.  <strong>1</strong> And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city.  <strong>2</strong> And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.  <strong>3</strong> And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.  <strong>4</strong> And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?  <strong>5</strong> For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  <strong>6</strong> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.  <strong>7</strong> And he arose, and departed to his house.  <strong>8</strong> But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God, which had given such power unto men.  <strong>9</strong> And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me.  And he arose, and followed him.  <strong>10</strong> And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.  <strong>11</strong> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?  <strong>12</strong> But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.  <strong>13</strong> But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. <strong>14</strong> Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?  <strong>15</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.  <strong>16</strong> No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse.  <strong>17</strong> Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. <strong>18</strong> While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.  <strong>19</strong> And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.  <strong>20</strong> And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:  <strong>21</strong> For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole.  <strong>22</strong> But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.  <strong>23</strong> And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,  <strong>24</strong> He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.  <strong>25</strong> But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.  <strong>26</strong> And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.  <strong>27</strong> And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.  <strong>28</strong> And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.  <strong>29</strong> Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.  <strong>30</strong> And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.  <strong>31</strong> But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.  <strong>32</strong> As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.  <strong>33</strong> And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.  <strong>34</strong> But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.  <strong>36</strong> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.  <strong>37</strong> Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is  plenteous, but the labourers are few;  <strong>38</strong> Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest. <strong>1</strong> And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.  <strong>2</strong> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;  <strong>3</strong> Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;  <strong>4</strong> Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  <strong>5</strong> These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not:  <strong>6</strong> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  <strong>8</strong> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.  <strong>9</strong> Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,  <strong>10</strong> Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.  <strong>11</strong> And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.  <strong>12</strong> And when ye come into an house, salute it.  <strong>13</strong> And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.  <strong>14</strong> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.  <strong>15</strong> Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city. <strong>16</strong>           Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.  <strong>17</strong> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;  <strong>18</strong> And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.  <strong>19</strong> But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.  <strong>20</strong> For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.  <strong>21</strong> And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their  parents, and cause them to be put to death.  <strong>22</strong> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.  <strong>23</strong> But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.  <strong>24</strong> The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.  <strong>25</strong> It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?  <strong>26</strong> Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.  <strong>27</strong> What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.  <strong>28</strong> And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.  <strong>29</strong> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.  <strong>30</strong> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  <strong>31</strong> Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.  <strong>32</strong> Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>33</strong> But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>34</strong> Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  <strong>35</strong> For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.  <strong>36</strong> And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.  <strong>37</strong> He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  <strong>38</strong> And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.  <strong>39</strong> He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. <strong>40</strong>           He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  <strong>41</strong> He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.  <strong>42</strong> And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When he came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, \"Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" Immediately he was cured of his leprosy. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to him, \"See that you don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Lord,\" he said, \"my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jesus said to him, \"I will go and heal him.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The centurion replied, \"Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.

that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,  <strong>19</strong> And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,  <strong>20</strong> Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,  <strong>21</strong> Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:  <strong>22</strong> And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,  <strong>23</strong> Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will-- <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment--to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even Christ. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession--to the praise of his glory. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
