Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.  <strong>28</strong> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.  <strong>29</strong> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.  <strong>30</strong> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.  <strong>31</strong> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.  <strong>32</strong> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men  unto me.  <strong>33</strong> This he said, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>34</strong> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?  who is this Son of man?  <strong>35</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.  <strong>36</strong> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.  <strong>37</strong> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:  <strong>38</strong> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  <strong>39</strong> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,  <strong>40</strong> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  <strong>41</strong> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.  <strong>42</strong> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:  <strong>43</strong> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.  <strong>44</strong> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.  <strong>45</strong> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.  <strong>46</strong> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.  <strong>47</strong> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.  <strong>48</strong> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.  <strong>49</strong> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  <strong>50</strong> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. \" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" Jesus replied. \"It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the Pharisees said to one another, \"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Father, glorify your name!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.\" The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"This voice was for your benefit, not mine. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\" When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: \"Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then Jesus cried out, \"When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.\" ","modified":"2023-04-04T21:41:57.297Z"},{"_id":"615a6cf8b7283e0c141b4ec9","topicId":"615a6cf7b7283e0c141b4ec7","verse":"Matthew 5:18","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40005018_01-2\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40005018-1\">18&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

March around the city, with the armed guard going ahead of the ark of the LORD.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the LORD went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the LORD's covenant followed them. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But Joshua had commanded the people, \"Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets kept sounding. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, \"Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it-men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, \"Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD's house. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho-and she lives among the Israelites to this day. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: \"Cursed before the LORD is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: \"At the cost of his firstborn son will he lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest will he set up its gates.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.
