For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name-the LORD your God- <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods-gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> In the morning you will say, \"If only it were evening!\" and in the evening, \"If only it were morning!\"-because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.

He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I am he,\" Jesus said.

(The servant's name was Malchus.) <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus commanded Peter, \"Put your sword away!

He replied, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have spoken openly to the world,\" Jesus replied. \"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Why question me? Ask those who heard me.

But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Pilate came out to them and asked, \"What charges are you bringing against this man?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"If he were not a criminal,\" they replied, \"we would not have handed him over to you.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Pilate said, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"But we have no right to execute anyone,\" the Jews objected. This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Is that your own idea,\" Jesus asked, \"or did others talk to you about me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Am I a Jew?\" Pilate replied. \"It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"You are a king, then!\" said Pilate. Jesus answered, \"You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"What is truth?\" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, \"I find no basis for a charge against him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They shouted back, \"No, not him! Give us Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.

and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.  <strong>18</strong> And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.  <strong>19</strong> And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:  <strong>20</strong> And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.  <strong>21</strong> And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.  <strong>22</strong> I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate.  <strong>23</strong> And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me;  <strong>24</strong> Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.  <strong>25</strong> And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.  <strong>26</strong> And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.  <strong>27</strong> And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;  <strong>28</strong> Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.  <strong>29</strong> And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.  <strong>30</strong> And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.  <strong>31</strong> And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.  <strong>32</strong> And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.  <strong>33</strong> And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.  <strong>34</strong> Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.  <strong>35</strong> As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.  <strong>36</strong> And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.  <strong>37</strong> And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.  <strong>38</strong> And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.  <strong>39</strong> And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.  <strong>40</strong> If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;  <strong>41</strong> And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:  <strong>42</strong> Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.  <strong>43</strong> The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.  <strong>44</strong> And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.  <strong>45</strong> But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.  <strong>46</strong> These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"'Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves, and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it.

I am the LORD. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"'If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I will send you rain in its season, and the ground will yield its crops and the trees of the field their fruit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting, and you will eat all the food you want and live in safety in your land. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"'I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down and no one will make you afraid. I will remove savage beasts from the land, and the sword will not pass through your country. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'I will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers, and I will keep my covenant with you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You will still be eating last year's harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will put my dwelling place among you, and I will not abhor you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the Egyptians; I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"'But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> then I will do this to you: I will bring upon you sudden terror, wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and drain away your life. You will plant seed in vain, because your enemies will eat it. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"'If after all this you will not listen to me, I will punish you for your sins seven times over. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Your strength will be spent in vain, because your soil will not yield its crops, nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"'If you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me, I will multiply your afflictions seven times over, as your sins deserve. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will send wild animals against you, and they will rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"'If in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And I will bring the sword upon you to avenge the breaking of the covenant. When you withdraw into your cities, I will send a plague among you, and you will be given into enemy hands. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When I cut off your supply of bread, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven, and they will dole out the bread by weight.

Your land will be laid waste, and your cities will lie in ruins. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All the time that it lies desolate, the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"'As for those of you who are left, I will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight.
