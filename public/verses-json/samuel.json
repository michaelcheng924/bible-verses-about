am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.  <strong>9</strong> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.  <strong>10</strong> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.  <strong>11</strong> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  <strong>12</strong> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.  <strong>13</strong> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <strong>14</strong> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.  <strong>15</strong> But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.  <strong>16</strong> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;  <strong>18</strong> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.  <strong>19</strong> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.  <strong>20</strong> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.  <strong>21</strong> For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.  <strong>22</strong> And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.  <strong>23</strong> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.  <strong>24</strong> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.  <strong>25</strong> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.  <strong>26</strong> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?  <strong>27</strong> And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.  <strong>28</strong> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.  <strong>29</strong> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?  <strong>30</strong> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.  <strong>31</strong> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.  <strong>32</strong> And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.  <strong>33</strong> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.  <strong>34</strong> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:  <strong>35</strong> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it  out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him  by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.  <strong>36</strong> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.  <strong>37</strong> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.  <strong>39</strong> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.  <strong>40</strong> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.  <strong>41</strong> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.  <strong>42</strong> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.  <strong>43</strong> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <strong>44</strong> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.  <strong>45</strong> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.  <strong>46</strong> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.  <strong>47</strong> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.  <strong>48</strong> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  <strong>49</strong> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.  <strong>50</strong> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.  <strong>51</strong> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.  <strong>52</strong> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.  <strong>53</strong> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.  <strong>54</strong> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.  <strong>55</strong> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.  <strong>56</strong> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.  <strong>57</strong> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  <strong>58</strong> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou  young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, \"Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the Philistine said, \"This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now Jesse said to his son David, \"Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now the Israelites had been saying, \"Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> David asked the men standing near him, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, \"This is what will be done for the man who kills him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, \"Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Now what have I done?\" said David. \"Can't I even speak?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Saul, \"Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" Saul said to David, \"Go, and the LORD be with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. \"I cannot go in these,\" he said to Saul, \"because I am not used to them.\" So he took them off. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Come here,\" he said, \"and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> David said to the Philistine, \"You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is that young man?\" Abner replied, \"As surely as you live, O king, I don't know.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The king said, \"Find out whose son this young man is.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"Whose son are you, young man?\" Saul asked him. David said, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.\" "},{"_id":"616a3f16a03c6e96020ba0da","topicId":"616a3f14a03c6e96020ba0d5","verse":"1 Samuel 12:1-5","votes":5,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p09012001_04-9\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v09012001-1\">12:1&nbsp;</b>And Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have obeyed your voice in all that you have said to me and have made a king over you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09012002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And now, behold, the king walks before you, and I am old and gray; and behold, my sons are with you.

And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.  <strong>16</strong> And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.  <strong>17</strong> And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.  <strong>18</strong> And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.  <strong>19</strong> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was  Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.  <strong>20</strong> And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.  <strong>21</strong> And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.  <strong>22</strong> And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.  <strong>23</strong> And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.  <strong>24</strong> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.  <strong>25</strong> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.  <strong>26</strong> And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, \"With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Cain, \"Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now Cain said to his brother Abel, \"Let's go out to the field.\" And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Cain, \"Where is your brother Abel?I don't know,\" he replied. \"Am I my brother's keeper?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The LORD said, \"What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Cain said to the LORD, \"My punishment is more than I can bear. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the LORD said to him, \"Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over.\" Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Cain went out from the LORD's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Lamech said to his wives, \"Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, \"God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of the LORD.

And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  <strong>2</strong> And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  <strong>3</strong> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  <strong>4</strong> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  <strong>5</strong> But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  <strong>6</strong> He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  <strong>7</strong> Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  <strong>16</strong> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  <strong>17</strong> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  <strong>18</strong> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  <strong>19</strong> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  <strong>20</strong> But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  <strong>21</strong> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  <strong>22</strong> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.  <strong>23</strong> Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  <strong>24</strong> Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.  <strong>25</strong> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.  <strong>26</strong> These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.  <strong>27</strong> But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  <strong>28</strong> And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.  <strong>29</strong> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

Say this to encourage Joab.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the LORD.

In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
