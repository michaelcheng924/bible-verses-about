 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"61636b46dc1be0273f8b6f67","topicId":"61636b43dc1be0273f8b6f5e","verse":"John 16:13","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43016013_01-10\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43016013-1\">13&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>13</strong> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
