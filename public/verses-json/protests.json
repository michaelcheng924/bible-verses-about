declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.  <strong>10</strong> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.  <strong>11</strong> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,  the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.  <strong>12</strong> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.  <strong>14</strong> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and  refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.  <strong>15</strong> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.  <strong>16</strong> And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.  <strong>17</strong> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.  <strong>18</strong> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.  <strong>19</strong> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD’S servant?  <strong>20</strong> Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.  <strong>22</strong> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are  all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.  <strong>23</strong> Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?  <strong>24</strong> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands will put their hope.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> This is what God the LORD says- he who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and all that comes out of it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Let the desert and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim his praise in the islands. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD will march out like a mighty man, like a warrior he will stir up his zeal; with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But those who trust in idols, who say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me, blind like the servant of the LORD? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You have seen many things, but have paid no attention; your ears are open, but you hear nothing.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It pleased the LORD for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, \"Send them back.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.

There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin-- <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. \"When Lysias the commander comes,\" he said, \"I will decide your case.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, \"That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.

and not to be set on a candlestick?  <strong>22</strong> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.  <strong>23</strong> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>24</strong> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.  <strong>25</strong> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.  <strong>26</strong> And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;  <strong>27</strong> And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.  <strong>28</strong> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.  <strong>29</strong> But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. <strong>30</strong> And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God?

It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He told them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> so that, \"'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The farmer sows the word. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But since they have no root, they last only a short time.

Instead, don't you put it on its stand? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Consider carefully what you hear,\" he continued. \"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Again he said, \"What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, \"Let us go over to the other side.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, don't you care if we drown?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, \"Quiet! Be still!\" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> He said to his disciples, \"Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> They were terrified and asked each other, \"Who is this?

 <strong>7</strong> For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities: but fear thou God.  <strong>8</strong> If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they.  <strong>9</strong> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself  is served by the field.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.  <strong>11</strong> When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them  with their eyes?  <strong>12</strong> The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.  <strong>13</strong> There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.  <strong>14</strong> But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.  <strong>15</strong> As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.  <strong>16</strong> And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?  <strong>17</strong> All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.  <strong>18</strong> Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.  <strong>19</strong> Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.  <strong>20</strong> For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.  <strong>1</strong> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is  common among men:  <strong>2</strong> A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.  <strong>3</strong> If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.  <strong>4</strong> For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.  <strong>5</strong> Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other.  <strong>6</strong> Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?  <strong>7</strong> All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.  <strong>8</strong> For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that knoweth to walk before the living?  <strong>9</strong> Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.  <strong>10</strong> That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.  <strong>11</strong> Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is  man the better?  <strong>12</strong> For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?  <strong>1</strong> A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.  <strong>2</strong>           It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.  <strong>3</strong> Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.  <strong>4</strong> The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.  <strong>5</strong> It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.  <strong>6</strong> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.  <strong>7</strong> Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.  <strong>8</strong> Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.  <strong>9</strong> Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.  <strong>10</strong> Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.  <strong>11</strong> Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is  profit to them that see the sun.  <strong>12</strong> For wisdom is a defence, and money is  a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.  <strong>13</strong> Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?  <strong>14</strong> In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.  <strong>15</strong> All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.  <strong>16</strong> Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?  <strong>17</strong> Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?  <strong>18</strong> It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.  <strong>19</strong> Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.  <strong>20</strong> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.  <strong>21</strong> Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:  <strong>22</strong> For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> As a dream comes when there are many cares, so the speech of a fool when there are many words. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, \"My vow was a mistake.\" Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore stand in awe of God.
