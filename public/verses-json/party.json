And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again.  <strong>7</strong> And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.  <strong>8</strong> And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.  <strong>9</strong> And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  <strong>11</strong> And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but  the LORD was not in the earthquake:  <strong>12</strong> And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was  not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.  <strong>13</strong> And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?  <strong>14</strong> And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.  <strong>15</strong> And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria:  <strong>16</strong> And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.  <strong>18</strong> Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.  <strong>19</strong> So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.  <strong>20</strong> And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.

Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, \"May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. \"I have had enough, LORD,\" he said. \"Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, \"Get up and eat.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, \"Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD said, \"Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.\" Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The LORD said to him, \"Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel-all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. \"Let me kiss my father and mother good-by,\" he said, \"and then I will come with you.Go back,\" Elijah replied. \"What have I done to you?\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.

And he came out the same hour.  <strong>19</strong> And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,  <strong>20</strong> And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,  <strong>21</strong> And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.  <strong>22</strong> And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.  <strong>23</strong> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them  into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely:  <strong>24</strong> Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.  <strong>25</strong> And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.  <strong>26</strong> And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.  <strong>27</strong> And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.  <strong>28</strong> But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.  <strong>29</strong> Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,  <strong>30</strong> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  <strong>31</strong> And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  <strong>32</strong> And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.  <strong>33</strong> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their  stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.  <strong>34</strong> And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.  <strong>35</strong> And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.  <strong>36</strong> And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.  <strong>37</strong> But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.  <strong>38</strong> And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.  <strong>39</strong> And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.  <strong>40</strong> And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of  Lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> He came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was a Jewess and a believer, but whose father was a Greek. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, \"Come over to Macedonia and help us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day on to Neapolis. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. \"If you consider me a believer in the Lord,\" she said, \"come and stay at my house.\" And she persuaded us. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, \"These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, \"In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!\" At that moment the spirit left her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> They brought them before the magistrates and said, \"These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But Paul shouted, \"Don't harm yourself! We are all here!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then brought them out and asked, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> They replied, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God--he and his whole family. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: \"Release those men.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The jailer told Paul, \"The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But Paul said to the officers: \"They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and encouraged them. Then they left.
