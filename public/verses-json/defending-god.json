When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The animals take cover; they remain in their dens. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth and show his love. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash? <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart? \" "},{"_id":"615d15d6c05ad52d15c55b7c","topicId":"615d15d0c05ad52d15c55b68","verse":"Job 36:20","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p18036020_01-22\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v18036020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not long for the night,</span><br><span id=\"p18036020_01-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when peoples vanish in their place.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>20</strong> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
