Does he who formed the eye not see? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD knows the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD, the man you teach from your law; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the LORD will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When I said, \"My foot is slipping,\" your love, O LORD, supported me. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Can a corrupt throne be allied with you- one that brings on misery by its decrees? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the LORD has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the LORD our God will destroy them.
