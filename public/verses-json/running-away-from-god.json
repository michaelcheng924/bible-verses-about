They declared a fast, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then he issued a proclamation in Nineveh: \"By the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let any man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened.
