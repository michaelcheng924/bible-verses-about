Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.  <strong>16</strong> For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.  <strong>18</strong> Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.  <strong>19</strong> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.  <strong>20</strong> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.  <strong>21</strong> For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.  <strong>22</strong> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?  <strong>23</strong> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.  <strong>24</strong>           There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.  <strong>25</strong> For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?  <strong>26</strong> For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.  <strong>1</strong> To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:  <strong>2</strong> A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;  <strong>3</strong> A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;  <strong>4</strong> A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;  <strong>5</strong> A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;  <strong>6</strong> A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;  <strong>7</strong> A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;  <strong>8</strong> A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.  <strong>9</strong> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?  <strong>10</strong> I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.  <strong>11</strong> He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.  <strong>12</strong> I know that there is no good in them, but for a man  to rejoice, and to do good in his life.  <strong>13</strong> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.  <strong>14</strong> I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.  <strong>15</strong> That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.  <strong>16</strong> And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that  wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.  <strong>17</strong> I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.  <strong>18</strong> I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.  <strong>19</strong> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.  <strong>20</strong> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.  <strong>21</strong> Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?  <strong>22</strong> Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And he was amazed at their lack of faith. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> These were his instructions: \"Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Wear sandals but not an extra tunic. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They went out and preached that people should repent. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said to him, \"That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\" When they found out, they said, \"Five--and two fish.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They all ate and were satisfied, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> because they all saw him and were terrified. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I.

They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.

Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.  <strong>7</strong> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.  <strong>8</strong> Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.  <strong>9</strong> As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.  <strong>10</strong> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.  <strong>11</strong> And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.  <strong>12</strong> Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.  <strong>13</strong> I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.  <strong>14</strong> So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.  <strong>15</strong> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>17</strong> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.  <strong>18</strong> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  <strong>19</strong> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.  <strong>20</strong> Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  <strong>21</strong> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.  <strong>22</strong> And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.  <strong>24</strong> Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.  <strong>25</strong> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:  <strong>26</strong> And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are  a rebellious house.  <strong>27</strong> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> And he said to me, \"Son of man, eat what is before you, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the house of Israel.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then he said to me, \"Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you and fill your stomach with it.\" So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He then said to me: \"Son of man, go now to the house of Israel and speak my words to them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> You are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language, but to the house of Israel- <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me, for the whole house of Israel is hardened and obstinate. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But I will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I will make your forehead like the hardest stone, harder than flint. Do not be afraid of them or terrified by them, though they are a rebellious house.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And he said to me, \"Son of man, listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Go now to your countrymen in exile and speak to them. Say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says,' whether they listen or fail to listen.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a loud rumbling sound-May the glory of the LORD be praised in his dwelling place!- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them, a loud rumbling sound. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Spirit then lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the LORD upon me. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I came to the exiles who lived at Tel Abib near the Kebar River. And there, where they were living, I sat among them for seven days-overwhelmed. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At the end of seven days the word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When I say to a wicked man, 'You will surely die,' and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order to save his life, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold you accountable for his blood. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But if you do warn the wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil ways, he will die for his sin; but you will have saved yourself. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, and I put a stumbling block before him, he will die. Since you did not warn him, he will die for his sin. The righteous things he did will not be remembered, and I will hold you accountable for his blood. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin, he will surely live because he took warning, and you will have saved yourself.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The hand of the LORD was upon me there, and he said to me, \"Get up and go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So I got up and went out to the plain. And the glory of the LORD was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell facedown. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet. He spoke to me and said: \"Go, shut yourself inside your house. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And you, son of man, they will tie with ropes; you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, though they are a rebellious house. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' Whoever will listen let him listen, and whoever will refuse let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
