And there was a division among them.  <strong>17</strong> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.  <strong>18</strong> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.  <strong>19</strong> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?  <strong>20</strong> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:  <strong>21</strong> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.  <strong>22</strong> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.  <strong>24</strong> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.  <strong>25</strong> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.  <strong>26</strong> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?  <strong>27</strong> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?  <strong>28</strong> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.  <strong>29</strong> We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow,  we know not from whence he is.  <strong>30</strong> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.  <strong>31</strong> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.  <strong>32</strong> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.  <strong>33</strong> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.  <strong>34</strong> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  <strong>35</strong> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  <strong>36</strong> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  <strong>37</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.  <strong>39</strong> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.  <strong>40</strong> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  <strong>41</strong> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> His disciples asked him, \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\" said Jesus, \"but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Go,\" he told him, \"wash in the Pool of Siloam\" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, \"Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Some claimed that he was. Others said, \"No, he only looks like him.\" But he himself insisted, \"I am the man.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"How then were your eyes opened?\" they demanded. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He replied, \"The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Where is this man?\" they asked him. \"I don't know,\" he said. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. \"He put mud on my eyes,\" the man replied, \"and I washed, and now I see.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.\" But others asked, \"How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?\" So they were divided. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Finally they turned again to the blind man, \"What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\" The man replied, \"He is a prophet.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Is this your son?\" they asked. \"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"We know he is our son,\" the parents answered, \"and we know he was born blind. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> That was why his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \"Give glory to God, \"they said. \"We know this man is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He replied, \"Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He answered, \"I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they hurled insults at him and said, \"You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The man answered, \"Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> To this they replied, \"You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!\" And they threw him out. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked. \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the man said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What? Are we blind too?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
