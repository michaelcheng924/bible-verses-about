This news made all the brothers very glad. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, \"The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The apostles and elders met to consider this question. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: \"Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When they finished, James spoke up: \"Brothers, listen to me. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Simon has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written: <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"'After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> that have been known for ages. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul-- <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, \"Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.  <strong>12</strong> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.  <strong>14</strong> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.  <strong>15</strong> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.  <strong>16</strong> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,  <strong>17</strong> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.  <strong>18</strong> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.  <strong>19</strong> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.  <strong>20</strong> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.  <strong>21</strong> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.  <strong>22</strong> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;  <strong>23</strong> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)  <strong>24</strong> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.  <strong>25</strong> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.  <strong>27</strong> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  <strong>28</strong> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  <strong>29</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  <strong>30</strong> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  <strong>31</strong> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  <strong>33</strong> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.  <strong>34</strong> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  <strong>36</strong> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.  <strong>37</strong> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  <strong>38</strong> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.  <strong>39</strong> And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.  <strong>40</strong> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>41</strong> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.  <strong>42</strong> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?  <strong>43</strong> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.  <strong>44</strong> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>45</strong> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.  <strong>47</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.  <strong>48</strong> I am that bread of life.  <strong>49</strong> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  <strong>50</strong> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.  <strong>51</strong> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.  <strong>52</strong> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  <strong>53</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.  <strong>54</strong> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>55</strong> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.  <strong>56</strong> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.  <strong>57</strong> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.  <strong>58</strong> This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.  <strong>59</strong> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.  <strong>60</strong> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,  said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  <strong>61</strong> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?  <strong>62</strong> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  <strong>63</strong> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.  <strong>64</strong> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.  <strong>65</strong> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. <strong>66</strong> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  <strong>67</strong> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  <strong>68</strong> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.  <strong>69</strong> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>70</strong> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?  <strong>71</strong> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Jewish Passover Feast was near. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Philip answered him, \"Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"from now on give us this bread.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> I am the bread of life. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.) "}]}
