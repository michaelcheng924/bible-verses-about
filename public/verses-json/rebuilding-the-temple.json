There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All these are the beginning of birth pains. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel--let the reader understand-- <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect--if that were possible. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> See, I have told you ahead of time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Immediately after the distress of those days \"'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn.

 <strong>36</strong> The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.  <strong>37</strong> And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.  <strong>38</strong> And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.  <strong>39</strong> And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.  <strong>40</strong> And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.  <strong>41</strong> Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.  <strong>42</strong> And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.  <strong>43</strong> And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.  <strong>44</strong> And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.  <strong>45</strong> And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.  <strong>46</strong> And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is  for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.  <strong>47</strong> So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.  <strong>48</strong> And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each  post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.  <strong>49</strong> The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city-on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me and he took me there. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man said to me, \"Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything you see.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man's hand was six long cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then he measured the portico of the gateway; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then he measured the width of the entrance to the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway-sixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico facing the courtyard. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then he measured the length and width of the gate facing north, leading into the outer court. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Its alcoves-three on each side-its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then he led me to the south side and I saw a gate facing south. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> (The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance to the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other-eight tables in all-on which the sacrifices were slaughtered. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high. On them were placed the utensils for slaughtering the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> And double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, were two rooms, one at the side of the north gate and facing south, and another at the side of the south gate and facing north. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> He said to me, \"The room facing south is for the priests who have charge of the temple, <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> and the room facing north is for the priests who have charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the LORD to minister before him.\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then he measured the court: It was square-a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on either side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on either side. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The portico was twenty cubits wide, and twelve cubits from front to back. It was reached by a flight of stairs, and there were pillars on each side of the jambs.

Have you gathered your hordes to loot, to carry off silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods and to seize much plunder?\"' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: In that day, when my people Israel are living in safety, will you not take notice of it? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You will come from your place in the far north, you and many nations with you, all of them riding on horses, a great horde, a mighty army. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud that covers the land. In days to come, O Gog, I will bring you against my land, so that the nations may know me when I show myself holy through you before their eyes. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Are you not the one I spoke of in former days by my servants the prophets of Israel? At that time they prophesied for years that I would bring you against them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This is what will happen in that day: When Gog attacks the land of Israel, my hot anger will be aroused, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In my zeal and fiery wrath I declare that at that time there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the beasts of the field, every creature that moves along the ground, and all the people on the face of the earth will tremble at my presence. The mountains will be overturned, the cliffs will crumble and every wall will fall to the ground. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Sovereign LORD. Every man's sword will be against his brother. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will execute judgment upon him with plague and bloodshed; I will pour down torrents of rain, hailstones and burning sulfur on him and on his troops and on the many nations with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And so I will show my greatness and my holiness, and I will make myself known in the sight of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD.'

<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"616a27bca03c6e96020b94bb","topicId":"616a27b6a03c6e96020b94a7","verse":"Deuteronomy 28:64","votes":7,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p05028064_01-22\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05028064-1\">64&nbsp;</b>“And the LORD will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>64</strong> And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.

 <strong>14</strong> And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.  <strong>16</strong> And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.  <strong>17</strong> So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.  <strong>18</strong> Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.  <strong>19</strong> And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.  <strong>20</strong> The ram which thou sawest having two horns are  the kings of Media and Persia.  <strong>21</strong> And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.  <strong>22</strong> Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.  <strong>23</strong> And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.  <strong>24</strong> And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.  <strong>25</strong> And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.  <strong>26</strong> And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is  true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be  for many days.  <strong>27</strong> And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, had a vision, after the one that had already appeared to me. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> In my vision I saw myself in the citadel of Susa in the province of Elam; in the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I looked up, and there before me was a ram with two horns, standing beside the canal, and the horns were long. One of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south. No animal could stand against him, and none could rescue from his power. He did as he pleased and became great. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> As I was thinking about this, suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I saw him attack the ram furiously, striking the ram and shattering his two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against him; the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him, and none could rescue the ram from his power. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The goat became very great, but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off, and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It set itself up to be as great as the Prince of the host; it took away the daily sacrifice from him, and the place of his sanctuary was brought low. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Because of rebellion, the host of the saints and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, \"How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled-the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He said to me, \"It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling, \"Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. \"Son of man,\" he said to me, \"understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He said: \"I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue, will arise. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
