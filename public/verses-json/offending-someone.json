For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you.

O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is  good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>2</strong> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?  <strong>3</strong> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.  <strong>4</strong> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto  thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;  <strong>5</strong> That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.  <strong>6</strong> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.  <strong>7</strong> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even  at the Red sea.  <strong>8</strong> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.  <strong>9</strong> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.  <strong>10</strong> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.  <strong>11</strong> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.  <strong>12</strong> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.  <strong>13</strong> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:  <strong>14</strong> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.  <strong>15</strong> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.  <strong>16</strong> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.  <strong>18</strong> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.  <strong>19</strong> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.  <strong>20</strong> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.  <strong>21</strong> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;  <strong>22</strong> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. <strong>24</strong> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:  <strong>25</strong> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.  <strong>26</strong> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:  <strong>27</strong> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.  <strong>28</strong> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.  <strong>29</strong> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.  <strong>30</strong> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.  <strong>31</strong> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.  <strong>32</strong> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:  <strong>33</strong> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.  <strong>34</strong> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:  <strong>35</strong> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.  <strong>36</strong> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.  <strong>37</strong> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,  <strong>38</strong> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.  <strong>39</strong> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.  <strong>40</strong> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.  <strong>41</strong> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.  <strong>42</strong> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.  <strong>43</strong> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.  <strong>44</strong> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:  <strong>45</strong> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.  <strong>46</strong> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.  <strong>47</strong> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.  <strong>48</strong> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Praise the LORD. Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they believed his promises and sang his praise. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So he said he would destroy them- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods; <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them; <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry; <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Let all the people say, \"Amen!\" Praise the LORD. "}]}
