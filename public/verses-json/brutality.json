 <strong>27</strong> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?  <strong>28</strong> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?  <strong>29</strong> Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.  <strong>30</strong> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.  <strong>31</strong> When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,  <strong>32</strong> Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.  <strong>33</strong> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.  <strong>34</strong> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.  <strong>35</strong> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.  <strong>36</strong> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.  <strong>37</strong> This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  <strong>38</strong> This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:  <strong>39</strong> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,  <strong>40</strong> Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for  this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  <strong>41</strong> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.  <strong>42</strong> Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?  <strong>43</strong> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.  <strong>44</strong> Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.  <strong>45</strong> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;  <strong>46</strong> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.  <strong>47</strong> But Solomon built him an house.  <strong>48</strong> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,  <strong>49</strong> Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?  <strong>50</strong> Hath not my hand made all these things?  <strong>51</strong> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.  <strong>52</strong> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:  <strong>53</strong> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.  <strong>54</strong> When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  <strong>55</strong> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,  <strong>56</strong> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.  <strong>57</strong> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,  <strong>58</strong> And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.  <strong>59</strong> And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.  <strong>60</strong> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, \"It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So the word of God spread.

So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"615a25ed6e3cd1721ad71682","topicId":"615a25e66e3cd1721ad7166c","verse":"Luke 21:34-36","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p42021034_03-24\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v42021034-1\">34&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v42021035-1\">35&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">For it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v42021036-1\">36&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">But stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.”</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>34</strong>           And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.  <strong>35</strong> For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.  <strong>36</strong> Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.
