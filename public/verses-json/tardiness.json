Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <strong>10</strong> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.  <strong>11</strong> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?  <strong>12</strong> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  <strong>13</strong> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.  <strong>14</strong> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.  <strong>15</strong> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.  <strong>16</strong> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:  <strong>17</strong> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.  <strong>18</strong> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.  <strong>19</strong> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  <strong>20</strong> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.  <strong>21</strong> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?  <strong>22</strong> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion.

May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.\" Then she kissed them and they wept aloud <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and said to her, \"We will go back with you to your people.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But Naomi said, \"Return home, my daughters.

Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Look,\" said Naomi, \"your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Ruth replied, \"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, \"Can this be Naomi?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Don't call me Naomi, \"she told them. \"Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty.
