They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  <strong>4</strong> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  <strong>5</strong> Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his  fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.  <strong>8</strong> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.  <strong>9</strong> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.  <strong>11</strong> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.  <strong>12</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  <strong>13</strong> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.  <strong>14</strong> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.  <strong>15</strong> So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.  <strong>16</strong> He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.  <strong>17</strong> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.  <strong>18</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.  <strong>19</strong> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>20</strong> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  <strong>21</strong> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?  <strong>22</strong> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.  <strong>23</strong> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?  <strong>24</strong> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.  <strong>25</strong> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.

It happened this way: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"I'm going out to fish,\" Simon Peter told them, and they said, \"We'll go with you.\" So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He called out to them, \"Friends, haven't you any fish?No,\" they answered. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said, \"Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\" When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \"It is the Lord!\" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, \"It is the Lord,\" he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Bring some of the fish you have just caught.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Come and have breakfast.\" None of the disciples dared ask him, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?Yes, Lord,\" he said, \"you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my lambs.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again Jesus said, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me?\" He answered, \"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Take care of my sheep.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The third time he said to him, \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" He said, \"Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Feed my sheep. I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, \"Follow me!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, \"Lord, who is going to betray you?\") <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Peter saw him, he asked, \"Lord, what about him?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \"Why do you look for the living among the dead? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then they remembered his words. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but they were kept from recognizing him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He asked them, \"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \"Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"What things?\" he asked. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and he took it and ate it in their presence. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He said to them, \"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He told them, \"This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> You are witnesses of these things. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.

But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.  <strong>28</strong> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  <strong>29</strong> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  <strong>30</strong> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  <strong>31</strong> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.  <strong>32</strong> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  <strong>33</strong> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.  <strong>34</strong> Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.  <strong>35</strong> But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?  <strong>36</strong> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:  <strong>37</strong> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:  <strong>38</strong> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.  <strong>39</strong> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.  <strong>40</strong> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  <strong>41</strong> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.  <strong>42</strong> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  <strong>43</strong> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:  <strong>44</strong> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  <strong>45</strong> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  <strong>46</strong> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  <strong>47</strong> The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.  <strong>48</strong> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  <strong>49</strong> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  <strong>50</strong> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  <strong>52</strong> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  <strong>53</strong> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  <strong>54</strong> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  <strong>55</strong> O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is  thy victory?  <strong>56</strong> The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is  the law.  <strong>57</strong> But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong>58</strong> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The last enemy to be destroyed is death. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For he \"has put everything under his feet.\" Now when it says that \"everything\" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I die every day--I mean that, brothers--just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, \"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Do not be misled: \"Bad company corrupts good character.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But someone may ask, \"How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> So it is written: \"The first man Adam became a living being\"; the last Adam, a lifegiving spirit. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed-- <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: \"Death has been swallowed up in victory.\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> \"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
