So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  <strong>17</strong> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.  <strong>19</strong> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;  <strong>20</strong> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of  the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of  that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.  <strong>21</strong> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <strong>22</strong> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.  <strong>23</strong> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <strong>24</strong> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  <strong>25</strong> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.  <strong>26</strong> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  <strong>27</strong> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.  <strong>28</strong> Hitherto is the end of the matter.

He wrote down the substance of his dream. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\" "},{"_id":"616b9c47ede035c13f932ea4","topicId":"616b9c42ede035c13f932e97","verse":"Psalm 119:99-102","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19119099_01-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19119099-1\">99&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have more understanding than all my teachers,</span><br><span id=\"p19119099_01-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your testimonies are my meditation.</span><br><span id=\"p19119100_01-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19119100-1\">100&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand more than the aged,</span><br><span id=\"p19119100_01-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I keep your precepts.</span><br><span id=\"p19119101_01-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19119101-1\">101&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold back my feet from every evil way,</span><br><span id=\"p19119101_01-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in order to keep your word.</span><br><span id=\"p19119102_01-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19119102-1\">102&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not turn aside from your rules,</span><br><span id=\"p19119102_01-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you have taught me.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>99</strong> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.  <strong>100</strong> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.  <strong>101</strong> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  <strong>102</strong> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> An oracle concerning the Valley of Vision: What troubles you now, that you have all gone up on the roofs, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> O town full of commotion, O city of tumult and revelry? Your slain were not killed by the sword, nor did they die in battle. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without using the bow. All you who were caught were taken prisoner together, having fled while the enemy was still far away. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Therefore I said, \"Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The Lord, the LORD Almighty, has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Elam takes up the quiver, with her charioteers and horses; Kir uncovers the shield. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the city gates; <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> the defenses of Judah are stripped away. And you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> you saw that the City of David had many breaches in its defenses; you stored up water in the Lower Pool. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or have regard for the One who planned it long ago. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The Lord, the LORD Almighty, called you on that day to weep and to wail, to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But see, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine! \"Let us eat and drink,\" you say, \"for tomorrow we die!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has revealed this in my hearing: \"Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for,\" says the Lord, the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says: \"Go, say to this steward, to Shebna, who is in charge of the palace: <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> What are you doing here and who gave you permission to cut out a grave for yourself here, hewing your grave on the height and chiseling your resting place in the rock? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Beware, the LORD is about to take firm hold of you and hurl you away, O you mighty man. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you into a large country. There you will die and there your splendid chariots will remain- you disgrace to your master's house! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will depose you from your office, and you will be ousted from your position. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will be a seat of honor for the house of his father. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots-all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"In that day,\" declares the LORD Almighty, \"the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down.\" The LORD has spoken.
