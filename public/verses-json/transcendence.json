To day if ye will hear his voice,  <strong>8</strong> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:  <strong>9</strong> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.  <strong>10</strong> Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:  <strong>11</strong> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For the LORD is the great God, the great King above all gods. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. Today, if you hear his voice, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the desert, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> where your fathers tested and tried me, though they had seen what I did. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, \"They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So I declared on oath in my anger, \"They shall never enter my rest.\" "},{"_id":"616c9e8416dfdfefa2036b2c","topicId":"616c9e7c16dfdfefa2036b14","verse":"Psalm 8:1-9","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<h4 id=\"p19008001_06-25\" class=\"psalm-title\">To the choirmaster: according to The Gittith.
