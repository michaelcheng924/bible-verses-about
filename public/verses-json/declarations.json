Go not from house to house.  <strong>8</strong> And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:  <strong>9</strong> And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.  <strong>10</strong> But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,  <strong>11</strong> Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.  <strong>12</strong> But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.  <strong>13</strong> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  <strong>14</strong> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.  <strong>15</strong> And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.  <strong>16</strong> He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. <strong>17</strong> And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.  <strong>18</strong> And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.  <strong>20</strong> Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.  <strong>21</strong> In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.  <strong>22</strong> All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.  <strong>23</strong> And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:  <strong>24</strong> For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. <strong>25</strong> And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  <strong>26</strong> He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?  <strong>27</strong> And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.  <strong>28</strong> And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.  <strong>29</strong> But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him  half dead.  <strong>31</strong> And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.  <strong>32</strong> And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.  <strong>33</strong> But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,  <strong>34</strong> And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  <strong>35</strong> And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.  <strong>36</strong> Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?  <strong>37</strong> And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. <strong>38</strong> Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.  <strong>39</strong> And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and heard his word.  <strong>40</strong> But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.  <strong>41</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:  <strong>42</strong> But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.

Do not move around from house to house. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> 'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The seventy-two returned with joy and said, \"Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He replied, \"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, \"I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. \"Teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"What is written in the Law?\" he replied. \"How do you read it?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He answered: \"'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"You have answered correctly,\" Jesus replied. \"Do this and you will live.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In reply Jesus said: \"A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The expert in the law replied, \"The one who had mercy on him.\" Jesus told him, \"Go and do likewise.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, \"Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Martha, Martha,\" the Lord answered, \"you are worried and upset about many things, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> but only one thing is needed.
