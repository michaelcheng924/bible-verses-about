Do bear with me! <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.</p>\n<p id=\"p47011006_06-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God’s gospel to you free of charge? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47011009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need.

God knoweth.  <strong>12</strong> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.  <strong>13</strong> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.  <strong>14</strong> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.  <strong>16</strong> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.  <strong>17</strong> That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.  <strong>18</strong> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.  <strong>19</strong> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.  <strong>20</strong> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.  <strong>21</strong> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.  <strong>22</strong> Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am  I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.  <strong>23</strong> Are they ministers of Christ?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those \"super-apostles.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge.

Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
