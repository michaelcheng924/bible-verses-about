So Pharaoh awoke.  <strong>5</strong> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.  <strong>6</strong> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.  <strong>7</strong> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.  <strong>9</strong> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:  <strong>10</strong> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker:  <strong>11</strong> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.  <strong>12</strong> And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.  <strong>13</strong> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.  <strong>14</strong> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.  <strong>15</strong> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is  none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that  thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.  <strong>16</strong> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.  <strong>17</strong> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:  <strong>18</strong> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:  <strong>19</strong> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:  <strong>20</strong> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:  <strong>21</strong> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.  <strong>22</strong> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:  <strong>23</strong> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:  <strong>24</strong> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this  unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.  <strong>25</strong> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.  <strong>26</strong> The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.  <strong>27</strong> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.  <strong>28</strong> This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.  <strong>29</strong> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:  <strong>30</strong> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;  <strong>31</strong> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.  <strong>32</strong> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is  because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.  <strong>33</strong> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.  <strong>34</strong> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.  <strong>35</strong> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.  <strong>36</strong> And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.  <strong>37</strong> And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.  <strong>38</strong> And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one  as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  <strong>39</strong> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:  <strong>40</strong> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.  <strong>41</strong> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.  <strong>42</strong> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;  <strong>43</strong> And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.  <strong>44</strong> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.  <strong>45</strong> And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.  <strong>46</strong> And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.  <strong>47</strong> And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.  <strong>48</strong> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.  <strong>49</strong> And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.  <strong>50</strong> And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.  <strong>51</strong> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.  <strong>52</strong> And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.  <strong>53</strong> And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.  <strong>54</strong> And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.  <strong>55</strong> And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.  <strong>56</strong> And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.  <strong>57</strong> And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;  because that the famine was so sore in all lands.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing by the Nile, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted-thin and scorched by the east wind. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \"Today I am reminded of my shortcomings. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"I cannot do it,\" Joseph replied to Pharaoh, \"but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After them, seven other cows came up-scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After them, seven other heads sprouted-withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \"The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So Pharaoh asked them, \"Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and men shouted before him, \"Make way!\" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout Egypt. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, \"It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The second son he named Ephraim and said, \"It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, \"Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the world.
