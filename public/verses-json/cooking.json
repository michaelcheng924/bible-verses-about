Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year's produce and store it in your towns, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the aliens, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.

Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,  <strong>21</strong> That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?  <strong>22</strong> And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)  <strong>24</strong> That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.  <strong>25</strong> Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.  <strong>26</strong> Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable;

 <strong>31</strong> In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;  <strong>32</strong> But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!  <strong>33</strong> They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.  <strong>34</strong> And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.  <strong>35</strong> Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:  <strong>36</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;  <strong>37</strong> Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.  <strong>38</strong> And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged;

behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.  <strong>44</strong> Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.  <strong>45</strong> Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.  <strong>46</strong> And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.  <strong>47</strong> Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing,  thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.  <strong>48</strong> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.  <strong>49</strong> Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  <strong>50</strong> And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.  <strong>51</strong> Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.  <strong>52</strong> Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.  <strong>53</strong> When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:  <strong>54</strong> That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.  <strong>55</strong> When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.  <strong>56</strong> For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,  <strong>57</strong> Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy  reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.  <strong>58</strong> Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.  <strong>59</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.  <strong>60</strong> Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.  <strong>61</strong> Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.  <strong>62</strong> And I will establish my covenant with thee;

Was your prostitution not enough? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"'Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all your other wickedness, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At the head of every street you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, offering your body with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and provoked me to anger with your increasing promiscuity. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"'How weak-willed you are, declares the Sovereign LORD, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When you built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"'You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Every prostitute receives a fee, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"'Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD! <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your wealth and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children's blood, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see all your nakedness. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring upon you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then I will hand you over to your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you naked and bare. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"'Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices? <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"'Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: \"Like mother, like daughter.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> You not only walked in their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> \"'However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them, <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines-all those around you who despise you. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the LORD. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> \"'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign LORD.'\" "},{"_id":"615bab477d79181a316711ff","topicId":"615bab3f7d79181a316711e6","verse":"Psalm 23:1-6","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<h4 id=\"p19023001_06-28\" class=\"psalm-title\">A Psalm of David.</h4>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023001_06-28\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v19023001-1\">23:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-28\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes me lie down in green pastures.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-28\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me beside still waters.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-28\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He restores my soul.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-28\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me in paths of righteousness</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his name’s sake.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023004_06-28\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will fear no evil,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-28\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are with me;</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your rod and your staff,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they comfort me.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023005_06-28\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You prepare a table before me</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of my enemies;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-28\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;you anoint my head with oil;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cup overflows.</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-28\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of my life,</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-28\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-28\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forever.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  <strong>2</strong> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  <strong>3</strong> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  <strong>4</strong> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  <strong>5</strong> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  <strong>6</strong> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
