 <strong>12</strong> For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.  <strong>13</strong> For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.  <strong>14</strong> For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.  <strong>15</strong> And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,  <strong>16</strong> Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  <strong>17</strong> For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.  <strong>18</strong> For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.  <strong>19</strong> For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.  <strong>20</strong> And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:  <strong>21</strong> (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art  a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)  <strong>22</strong> By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.  <strong>23</strong> And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:  <strong>24</strong> But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.  <strong>25</strong> Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.  <strong>26</strong> For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;  <strong>27</strong> Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.  <strong>28</strong> For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.

Others became priests without any oath, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: \"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Such a high priest meets our need--one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.

Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
