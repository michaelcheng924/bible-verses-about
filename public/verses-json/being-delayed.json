He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?\" says the Holy One. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, \"My way is hidden from the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God\"? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength.
