thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  <strong>24</strong> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:  <strong>25</strong> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.  <strong>26</strong> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:  <strong>27</strong> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.  <strong>28</strong> Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.  <strong>29</strong> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.  <strong>30</strong> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <strong>31</strong>           When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:  <strong>32</strong> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:  <strong>33</strong> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.  <strong>34</strong> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:  <strong>35</strong> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:  <strong>36</strong> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.  <strong>37</strong> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee  drink?  <strong>38</strong> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  <strong>39</strong> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  <strong>40</strong> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.  <strong>41</strong> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:  <strong>42</strong> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:  <strong>43</strong> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.  <strong>44</strong> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  <strong>45</strong> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.  <strong>46</strong> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  <strong>15</strong> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  <strong>16</strong> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <strong>17</strong>           Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  <strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <strong>21</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  <strong>24</strong> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <strong>25</strong> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  <strong>26</strong> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <strong>27</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  <strong>28</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  <strong>29</strong> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>30</strong> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>31</strong> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  <strong>32</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <strong>33</strong>           Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  <strong>34</strong> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  <strong>35</strong> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  <strong>36</strong> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  <strong>37</strong> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <strong>38</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  <strong>39</strong> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  <strong>40</strong> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.  <strong>41</strong> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  <strong>42</strong> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <strong>43</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  <strong>44</strong> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  <strong>45</strong> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  <strong>46</strong> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  <strong>47</strong> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  <strong>48</strong> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. <strong>1</strong>           Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.  <strong>2</strong> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>3</strong> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  <strong>4</strong> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <strong>5</strong>           And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  <strong>7</strong> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  <strong>8</strong> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  <strong>9</strong> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  <strong>10</strong> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is  in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> Give us this day our daily bread.  <strong>12</strong> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  <strong>13</strong> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  <strong>14</strong> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:  <strong>15</strong> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <strong>16</strong>           Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>17</strong> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  <strong>18</strong> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  <strong>19</strong>           Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  <strong>20</strong> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:  <strong>21</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>22</strong> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  <strong>23</strong> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is  that darkness! <strong>24</strong>           No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  <strong>26</strong> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  <strong>27</strong> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  <strong>28</strong> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:  <strong>29</strong> And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  <strong>31</strong> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  <strong>32</strong> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  <strong>33</strong> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>34</strong> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. <strong>1</strong>           Judge not, that ye be not judged.  <strong>2</strong> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  <strong>3</strong> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  <strong>4</strong> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?  <strong>5</strong> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.  <strong>6</strong>           Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. <strong>7</strong>           Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:  <strong>8</strong> For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  <strong>9</strong> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?  <strong>10</strong> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  <strong>11</strong> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?  <strong>12</strong> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. <strong>13</strong>           Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:  <strong>14</strong> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is  the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. <strong>15</strong>           Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  <strong>16</strong> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  <strong>17</strong> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  <strong>18</strong> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  <strong>19</strong> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. <strong>21</strong>           Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>22</strong> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  <strong>23</strong> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <strong>24</strong>           Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:  <strong>25</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  <strong>26</strong> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:  <strong>27</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.  <strong>28</strong> And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:  <strong>29</strong> For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and he began to teach them saying: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.

Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?  <strong>9</strong> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:  <strong>10</strong> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.  <strong>11</strong> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.  <strong>12</strong> I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.  <strong>13</strong> And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.  <strong>14</strong> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather  than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.  <strong>15</strong> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.  <strong>16</strong> But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.  <strong>17</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.  <strong>18</strong> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  <strong>19</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is  good, save one, that is, God.  <strong>20</strong> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.  <strong>21</strong> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.  <strong>22</strong> Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.  <strong>23</strong> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.  <strong>24</strong> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!  <strong>25</strong> For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>26</strong> And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?  <strong>27</strong> And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.  <strong>28</strong> Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.  <strong>29</strong> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,  <strong>30</strong> Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. <strong>31</strong> Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.  <strong>32</strong> For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:  <strong>33</strong> And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.  <strong>34</strong> And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.  <strong>35</strong> And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:  <strong>36</strong> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.  <strong>37</strong> And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.  <strong>38</strong> And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>39</strong> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>40</strong> And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,  <strong>41</strong> Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?

He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Jesus called the children to him and said, \"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A certain ruler asked him, \"Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good--except God alone. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"All these I have kept since I was a boy,\" he said. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Jesus heard this, he said to him, \"You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus looked at him and said, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Those who heard this asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"What is impossible with men is possible with God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Peter said to him, \"We have left all we had to follow you!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus said to them, \"no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, \"We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He will be handed over to the Gentiles.

It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He told them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you.

Instead, don't you put it on its stand? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Consider carefully what you hear,\" he continued. \"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Again he said, \"What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, \"Let us go over to the other side.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, don't you care if we drown?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, \"Quiet! Be still!\" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> He said to his disciples, \"Why are you so afraid?
