Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.  <strong>13</strong> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.  <strong>15</strong> And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.  <strong>16</strong> And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.  <strong>17</strong> And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.  <strong>18</strong> And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.  <strong>19</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.  <strong>20</strong> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.  <strong>21</strong> And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  <strong>22</strong> And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.  <strong>23</strong> For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  <strong>24</strong> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.  <strong>25</strong> And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)  <strong>26</strong> Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is  on the LORD’S side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.  <strong>27</strong> And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.  <strong>28</strong> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.  <strong>29</strong> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.  <strong>31</strong> And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.  <strong>32</strong> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.  <strong>33</strong> And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.  <strong>34</strong> Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.  <strong>35</strong> And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, \"Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Aaron answered them, \"Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, \"These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, \"Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, \"Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.' <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"I have seen these people,\" the LORD said to Moses, \"and they are a stiff-necked people. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. \"O LORD,\" he said, \"why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, \"There is the sound of war in the camp.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Moses replied: \"It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to Aaron, \"What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Do not be angry, my lord,\" Aaron answered. \"You know how prone these people are to evil. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, \"Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.\" And all the Levites rallied to him. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then he said to them, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then Moses said, \"You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The next day Moses said to the people, \"You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So Moses went back to the LORD and said, \"Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But now, please forgive their sin-but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The LORD replied to Moses, \"Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.

Do you believe this?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she told him, \"I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. \"The Teacher is here,\" she said, \"and is asking for you.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Where have you laid him?\" he asked. \"Come and see, Lord,\" they replied. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus wept. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Take away the stone,\" he said. \"But, Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"What are we accomplishing?\" they asked. \"Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, \"You know nothing at all! <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> So from that day on they plotted to take his life. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, \"What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.
