In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Naboth replied, \"The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, \"I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.\" He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, \"Why are you so sullen? Why won't you eat?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He answered her, \"Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.'

I'll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city with him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> In those letters she wrote: \"Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, \"Naboth has cursed both God and the king.\" So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then they sent word to Jezebel: \"Naboth has been stoned and is dead.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, \"Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth's vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood-yes, yours!'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Ahab said to Elijah, \"So you have found me, my enemy!I have found you,\" he answered, \"because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> 'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel-slave or free. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"And also concerning Jezebel the LORD says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> (There was never a man like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, urged on by Jezebel his wife. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the LORD drove out before Israel.) <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The tempter came to him and said, \"If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"If you are the Son of God,\" he said, \"throw yourself down. For it is written: \"'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"All this I will give you,\" he said, \"if you will bow down and worship me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said to him, \"Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali-- <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles-- <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> From that time on Jesus began to preach, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> At once they left their nets and followed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.
