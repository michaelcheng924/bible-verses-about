And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD.  <strong>3</strong> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and bare him a son.  <strong>4</strong> And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.  <strong>5</strong> And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.  <strong>6</strong> And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away.  <strong>7</strong> But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.  <strong>8</strong> Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.  <strong>9</strong> Then said God, Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye are  not my people, and I will not be your God. <strong>10</strong> Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are  not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are  the sons of the living God.  <strong>11</strong> Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of Jezreel.  <strong>1</strong> Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi;

for they be the children of whoredoms.  <strong>5</strong> For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.  <strong>6</strong> Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.  <strong>7</strong> And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it  better with me than now.  <strong>8</strong> For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.  <strong>10</strong> And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.  <strong>11</strong> I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.  <strong>12</strong> And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.  <strong>13</strong> And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.  <strong>15</strong> And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.  <strong>16</strong> And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.  <strong>17</strong> For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.  <strong>18</strong> And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.  <strong>19</strong> And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.  <strong>20</strong> I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;  <strong>22</strong> And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hear Jezreel.  <strong>23</strong> And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were  not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.  <strong>1</strong> Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her  friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.  <strong>2</strong> So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:  <strong>3</strong> And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.  <strong>4</strong> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:  <strong>5</strong> Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The word of the LORD that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When the LORD began to speak through Hosea, the LORD said to him, \"Go, take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness, because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the LORD.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
