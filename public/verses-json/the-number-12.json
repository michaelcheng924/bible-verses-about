If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.  <strong>3</strong> Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.  <strong>4</strong> Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.  <strong>5</strong> Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!  <strong>6</strong> And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.  <strong>7</strong> For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:  <strong>8</strong> But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.  <strong>9</strong> Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.  <strong>10</strong> Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.  <strong>11</strong> Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water  and bitter?  <strong>12</strong> Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.  <strong>13</strong> Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.  <strong>14</strong> But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.  <strong>15</strong> This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.  <strong>16</strong> For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.  <strong>17</strong> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.  <strong>18</strong> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.  <strong>1</strong> From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they  not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?  <strong>2</strong> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.  <strong>3</strong> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.  <strong>4</strong> Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.  <strong>5</strong> Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?  <strong>6</strong> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.  <strong>7</strong> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  <strong>8</strong> Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your  hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.  <strong>9</strong> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.  <strong>10</strong> Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.  <strong>11</strong> Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.  <strong>12</strong> There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?  <strong>13</strong> Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:  <strong>14</strong> Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.  <strong>15</strong> For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.  <strong>16</strong> But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.  <strong>1</strong> Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.  <strong>2</strong> Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.  <strong>3</strong> Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.  <strong>4</strong> Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.  <strong>5</strong> Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.  <strong>6</strong> Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.  <strong>7</strong> Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.  <strong>8</strong> Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.  <strong>9</strong> Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.  <strong>10</strong> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.  <strong>12</strong> But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.  <strong>13</strong> Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.  <strong>14</strong> Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:  <strong>15</strong> And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.  <strong>16</strong> Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.  <strong>17</strong> Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.  <strong>18</strong> And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.  <strong>19</strong> Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;  <strong>20</strong> Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and asked them, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" They answered, \"No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you receive?John's baptism,\" they replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> There were about twelve men in all. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, \"In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> One day the evil spirit answered them, \"Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. \"After I have been there,\" he said, \"I must visit Rome also.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: \"Men, you know we receive a good income from this business. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: \"Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.

 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
