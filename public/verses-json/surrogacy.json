And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is  good for a man not to touch a woman.  <strong>2</strong> Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.  <strong>3</strong> Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.  <strong>4</strong> The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.  <strong>5</strong> Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.  <strong>6</strong> But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.  <strong>7</strong> For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

You know how much work I've done for you.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Laban said to him, \"If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He added, \"Name your wages, and I will pay them.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jacob said to him, \"You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"What shall I give you?\" he asked. \"Don't give me anything,\" Jacob replied. \"But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them: <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Agreed,\" said Laban. \"Let it be as you have said.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban's animals. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.

And he knew her again no more.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.  <strong>28</strong> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.  <strong>30</strong> And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Judah said to Onan, \"Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so he put him to death also. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, \"Live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up.\" For he thought, \"He may die too, just like his brothers.\" So Tamar went to live in her father's house. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Tamar was told, \"Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, \"Come now, let me sleep with you.And what will you give me to sleep with you?\" she asked. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I'll send you a young goat from my flock,\" he said. \"Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?\" she asked. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He said, \"What pledge should I give you?Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,\" she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He asked the men who lived there, \"Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here,\" they said. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So he went back to Judah and said, \"I didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, 'There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.'\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Judah said, \"Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> About three months later Judah was told, \"Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.\" Judah said, \"Bring her out and have her burned to death!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. \"I am pregnant by the man who owns these,\" she said. And she added, \"See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Judah recognized them and said, \"She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah.\" And he did not sleep with her again. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, \"This one came out first.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, \"So this is how you have broken out!\" And he was named Perez. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out and he was given the name Zerah.
