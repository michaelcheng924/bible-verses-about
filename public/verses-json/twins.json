have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, \"Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count the worshipers there. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> These men have power to shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For three and a half days men from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, \"Come up here.\" And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: \"The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> saying: \"We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The nations were angry; and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name, both small and great--and for destroying those who destroy the earth.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a great hailstorm.
