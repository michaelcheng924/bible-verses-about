But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Each one should test his own actions.

A man reaps what he sows. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand! <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised.
