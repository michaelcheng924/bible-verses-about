There the hand of the LORD was upon him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north-an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was that of a man, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> but each of them had four faces and four wings. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man. All four of them had faces and wings, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> and their wings touched one another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a man, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out upward; each had two wings, one touching the wing of another creature on either side, and two wings covering its body. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like chrysolite, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like ice, and awesome. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.

Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  <strong>22</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "},{"_id":"6158ff2d5788f063699d8554","topicId":"6158ff2c5788f063699d8550","verse":"Acts 2:1-11","votes":5,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p44002001_07-4\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v44002001-1\">2:1&nbsp;</b>When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"p44002004_07-4\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And they were amazed and astonished, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44002011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.”</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.  <strong>2</strong> And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.  <strong>3</strong> And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.  <strong>4</strong> And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.  <strong>5</strong> And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.  <strong>6</strong> Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.  <strong>7</strong> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.

Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and said, \"Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus-- <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> he was one of our number and shared in this ministry.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"For,\" said Peter, \"it is written in the book of Psalms, \"'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, \"'May another take his place of leadership.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then they prayed, \"Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
