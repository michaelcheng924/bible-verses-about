And I set a great assembly against them.  <strong>8</strong> And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.  <strong>9</strong> Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies?  <strong>10</strong> I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.  <strong>11</strong> Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.  <strong>12</strong> Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.  <strong>13</strong> Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied.

I told them, \"You are exacting usury from your own countrymen!\" So I called together a large meeting to deal with them <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and said: \"As far as possible, we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!\" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So I continued, \"What you are doing is not right.

We will do as you say.\" Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, \"In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied!\" At this the whole assembly said, \"Amen,\" and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
