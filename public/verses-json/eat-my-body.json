Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.  <strong>12</strong> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.  <strong>14</strong> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.  <strong>15</strong> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.  <strong>16</strong> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,  <strong>17</strong> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.  <strong>18</strong> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.  <strong>19</strong> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.  <strong>20</strong> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.  <strong>21</strong> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.  <strong>22</strong> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;  <strong>23</strong> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)  <strong>24</strong> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.  <strong>25</strong> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.  <strong>27</strong> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  <strong>28</strong> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  <strong>29</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  <strong>30</strong> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  <strong>31</strong> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  <strong>33</strong> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.  <strong>34</strong> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  <strong>36</strong> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.  <strong>37</strong> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  <strong>38</strong> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.  <strong>39</strong> And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.  <strong>40</strong> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>41</strong> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.  <strong>42</strong> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?  <strong>43</strong> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.  <strong>44</strong> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>45</strong> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.

Let nothing be wasted.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"from now on give us this bread.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> I am the bread of life. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)

And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.  <strong>16</strong> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.  <strong>17</strong> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?  <strong>18</strong> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.  <strong>19</strong> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.  <strong>20</strong> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  <strong>21</strong> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  <strong>22</strong> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  <strong>23</strong> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  <strong>24</strong> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.  <strong>25</strong> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. <strong>26</strong> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,  and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.  <strong>27</strong> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;  <strong>28</strong> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.  <strong>29</strong> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.  <strong>30</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>31</strong> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  <strong>32</strong> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>33</strong> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.  <strong>34</strong> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>35</strong> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.  <strong>36</strong> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.  <strong>37</strong> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.  <strong>38</strong> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.  <strong>39</strong> And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.  <strong>40</strong> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  <strong>41</strong> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>42</strong> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.  <strong>43</strong> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.  <strong>44</strong> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.  <strong>45</strong> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>46</strong> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.  <strong>47</strong> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  <strong>48</strong> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.  <strong>49</strong> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.  <strong>50</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  <strong>51</strong> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his  hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.  <strong>52</strong> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  <strong>53</strong> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  <strong>54</strong> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  <strong>55</strong> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.  <strong>56</strong> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.  <strong>57</strong> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.  <strong>58</strong> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  <strong>59</strong> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  <strong>60</strong> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet  found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,  <strong>61</strong> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.  <strong>62</strong> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>63</strong> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.  <strong>64</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>65</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.  <strong>66</strong> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.  <strong>67</strong> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,  <strong>68</strong> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?  <strong>69</strong> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.  <strong>70</strong> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.  <strong>71</strong> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>72</strong> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.  <strong>73</strong> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  <strong>74</strong> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.  <strong>75</strong> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Finally two came forward and declared, \"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, \"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. \"But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, \"He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> What do you think?He is worthy of death,\" they answered. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> and said, \"Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?\" <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. \"You also were with Jesus of Galilee,\" she said. <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> But he denied it before them all. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said. <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, \"This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> He denied it again, with an oath: \"I don't know the man!\" <sup><strong>73</strong></sup> After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \"Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away.\" <sup><strong>74</strong></sup> Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, \"I don't know the man!\" <sup><strong>75</strong></sup> Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.

Others became priests without any oath, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him: \"The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Such a high priest meets our need--one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.

What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
