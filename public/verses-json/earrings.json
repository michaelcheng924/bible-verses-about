(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:  <strong>4</strong> For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  <strong>5</strong> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.  <strong>6</strong> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  <strong>7</strong> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  <strong>8</strong> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>9</strong> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  <strong>10</strong> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is  not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  <strong>11</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>12</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  <strong>13</strong> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <strong>14</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here:  and he shall slay me.  <strong>15</strong> And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.  <strong>16</strong> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.  <strong>20</strong> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.  <strong>21</strong> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.  <strong>23</strong> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it  on wood, and put no fire under:  <strong>24</strong> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.

And he said, Go again seven times.  <strong>44</strong> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.  <strong>45</strong> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.  <strong>46</strong> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: \"Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Ahab had said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, \"Is it really you, my lord Elijah?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What have I done wrong,\" asked Obadiah, \"that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Elijah said, \"As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he saw Elijah, he said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have not made trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Elijah went before the people and said, \"How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.\" But the people said nothing. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to them, \"I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire-he is God.\" Then all the people said, \"What you say is good.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. \"O Baal, answer us!\" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At noon Elijah began to taunt them. \"Shout louder!\" he said. \"Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come here to me.\" They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Your name shall be Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Do it again,\" he said, and they did it again. \"Do it a third time,\" he ordered, and they did it the third time. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, \"The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Elijah commanded them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!\" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Go and look toward the sea,\" he told his servant. And he went up and looked. \"There is nothing there,\" he said. Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The seventh time the servant reported, \"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" So Elijah said, \"Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.

Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <strong>2</strong> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.  <strong>27</strong> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.  <strong>28</strong> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.  <strong>29</strong> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.  <strong>30</strong> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.  <strong>31</strong> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench
