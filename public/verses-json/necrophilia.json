Instead, be filled with the Spirit. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> for we are members of his body. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
