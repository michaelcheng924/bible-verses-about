 <strong>15</strong> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.  <strong>16</strong> A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  <strong>17</strong> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  <strong>18</strong> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.  <strong>19</strong> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.  <strong>20</strong> A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  <strong>21</strong> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.  <strong>22</strong> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  <strong>24</strong> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.  <strong>1</strong> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.  <strong>2</strong> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is  not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.  <strong>3</strong> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.  <strong>4</strong> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.  <strong>5</strong> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.  <strong>6</strong> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is  a friend to him that giveth gifts.  <strong>7</strong> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him?
