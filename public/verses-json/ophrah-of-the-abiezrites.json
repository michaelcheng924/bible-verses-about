And he did so.  <strong>21</strong> Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.  <strong>22</strong> And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.  <strong>23</strong> And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.  <strong>24</strong> Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.  <strong>25</strong> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:  <strong>26</strong> And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.  <strong>27</strong> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.  <strong>28</strong> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was  by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was  built.  <strong>29</strong> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.  <strong>30</strong> Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.  <strong>31</strong> And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.  <strong>32</strong> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.  <strong>33</strong> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.  <strong>34</strong> But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him.  <strong>35</strong> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.  <strong>36</strong> And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,  <strong>37</strong> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.  <strong>38</strong> And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.  <strong>39</strong> And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.  <strong>40</strong> And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the Israelites cried to the LORD because of Midian, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> he sent them a prophet, who said, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, \"The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"But sir,\" Gideon replied, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"But Lord, \"Gideon asked, \"how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The LORD answered, \"I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Gideon replied, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.\" And the LORD said, \"I will wait until you return.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.\" And Gideon did so. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, \"Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the LORD said to him, \"Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They asked each other, \"Who did this?\" When they carefully investigated, they were told, \"Gideon son of Joash did it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The men of the town demanded of Joash, \"Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, \"Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So that day they called Gideon \"Jerub-Baal, \"saying, \"Let Baal contend with him,\" because he broke down Baal's altar. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised- <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew-a bowlful of water. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Gideon said to God, \"Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.

And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.  <strong>4</strong> And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too  many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.  <strong>5</strong> So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.  <strong>6</strong> And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.  <strong>7</strong> And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.  <strong>8</strong> So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.  <strong>9</strong> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.  <strong>10</strong> But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:  <strong>11</strong> And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.  <strong>12</strong> And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.  <strong>13</strong> And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.  <strong>14</strong> And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.  <strong>15</strong> And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.  <strong>16</strong> And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.  <strong>17</strong> And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.  <strong>18</strong> When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.  <strong>19</strong> So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.  <strong>20</strong> And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.  <strong>21</strong> And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.  <strong>22</strong> And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.  <strong>23</strong> And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites.  <strong>24</strong> And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah and Jordan.  <strong>25</strong> And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The LORD said to Gideon, \"You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> announce now to the people, 'Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.'\" So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But the LORD said to Gideon, \"There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go; but if I say, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, \"Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD said to Gideon, \"With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> During that night the LORD said to Gideon, \"Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.\" So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. \"I had a dream,\" he was saying. \"A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> His friend responded, \"This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, \"Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Watch me,\" he told them. \"Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, \"A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, \"Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah.\" So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.

But to those who do not believe, \"The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, \" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and, \"A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.\" They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.  <strong>29</strong> And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.  <strong>30</strong> And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives.  <strong>31</strong> And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.  <strong>32</strong> And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.  <strong>33</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.  <strong>34</strong> And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:  <strong>35</strong> Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely,  Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, \"Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?\" And they criticized him sharply. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But he answered them, \"What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?\" At this, their resentment against him subsided. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He said to the men of Succoth, \"Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the officials of Succoth said, \"Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then Gideon replied, \"Just for that, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> From there he went up to Peniel and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Succoth had. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So he said to the men of Peniel, \"When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and fell upon the unsuspecting army. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He caught a young man of Succoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Succoth, the elders of the town. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth, \"Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, 'Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, \"What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?Men like you,\" they answered, \"each one with the bearing of a prince.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Gideon replied, \"Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, \"Kill them!\" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Zebah and Zalmunna said, \"Come, do it yourself. 'As is the man, so is his strength.'\" So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels' necks. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The Israelites said to Gideon, \"Rule over us-you, your son and your grandson-because you have saved us out of the hand of Midian.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But Gideon told them, \"I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And he said, \"I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.\" (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> They answered, \"We'll be glad to give them.\" So they spread out a garment, and each man threw a ring from his plunder onto it. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels' necks. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land enjoyed peace forty years. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god and <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> They also failed to show kindness to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for them.
