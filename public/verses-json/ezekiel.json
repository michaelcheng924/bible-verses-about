Thus were  their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.  <strong>5</strong> And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,  <strong>6</strong> Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.  <strong>7</strong> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were  the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.  <strong>8</strong> Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.  <strong>9</strong> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.  <strong>10</strong> These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.  <strong>11</strong> And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.  <strong>12</strong> She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.  <strong>13</strong> Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took  both one way,  <strong>14</strong> And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,  <strong>15</strong> Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:  <strong>16</strong> And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.  <strong>17</strong> And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.  <strong>18</strong> So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.  <strong>19</strong> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.  <strong>20</strong> For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  <strong>21</strong> Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;  <strong>23</strong> The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.  <strong>24</strong> And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.  <strong>25</strong> And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.  <strong>26</strong> They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.  <strong>27</strong> Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.  <strong>28</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:  <strong>29</strong> And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>30</strong> I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.  <strong>31</strong> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.  <strong>32</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.  <strong>33</strong> Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.  <strong>34</strong> Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>35</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>36</strong> The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;  <strong>37</strong> That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.  <strong>38</strong> Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.  <strong>39</strong> For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.  <strong>40</strong> And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,  <strong>41</strong> And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.  <strong>42</strong> And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.  <strong>43</strong> Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  <strong>44</strong> Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.  <strong>45</strong> And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.  <strong>46</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.  <strong>47</strong> And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.  <strong>48</strong> Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.  <strong>49</strong> And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians-warriors <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She too lusted after the Assyrians-governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets.

Your lewdness and promiscuity <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> have brought this upon you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"You will drink your sister's cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You will drink it and drain it dry; you will dash it to pieces and tear your breasts.

 <strong>31</strong> In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;  <strong>32</strong> But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!  <strong>33</strong> They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.  <strong>34</strong> And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.  <strong>35</strong> Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:  <strong>36</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;  <strong>37</strong> Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.  <strong>38</strong> And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.  <strong>39</strong> And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.  <strong>40</strong> They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.  <strong>41</strong> And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.  <strong>42</strong> So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.  <strong>43</strong> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.  <strong>44</strong> Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.  <strong>45</strong> Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.  <strong>46</strong> And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.  <strong>47</strong> Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing,  thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.  <strong>48</strong> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.  <strong>49</strong> Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  <strong>50</strong> And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.  <strong>51</strong> Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.  <strong>52</strong> Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.  <strong>53</strong> When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:  <strong>54</strong> That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.  <strong>55</strong> When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.  <strong>56</strong> For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,  <strong>57</strong> Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy  reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.  <strong>58</strong> Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.  <strong>59</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.  <strong>60</strong> Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.  <strong>61</strong> Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.  <strong>62</strong> And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:  <strong>63</strong> That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"'Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, \"Live!\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, you who were naked and bare. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became mine. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was fine flour, honey and olive oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"'But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. Such things should not happen, nor should they ever occur. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Also the food I provided for you-the fine flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat-you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"'Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all your other wickedness, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At the head of every street you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, offering your body with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and provoked me to anger with your increasing promiscuity. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia, a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"'How weak-willed you are, declares the Sovereign LORD, when you do all these things, acting like a brazen prostitute! <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When you built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"'You adulterous wife! You prefer strangers to your own husband! <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Every prostitute receives a fee, but you give gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"'Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the LORD! <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Because you poured out your wealth and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children's blood, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated. I will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them, and they will see all your nakedness. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring upon you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then I will hand you over to your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines. They will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you naked and bare. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"'Because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things, I will surely bring down on your head what you have done, declares the Sovereign LORD. Did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices? <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"'Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: \"Like mother, like daughter.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> You not only walked in their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"'Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Bear your disgrace, for you have furnished some justification for your sisters. Because your sins were more vile than theirs, they appear more righteous than you. So then, be ashamed and bear your disgrace, for you have made your sisters appear righteous. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> \"'However, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters and of Samaria and her daughters, and your fortunes along with them, <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> And your sisters, Sodom with her daughters and Samaria with her daughters, will return to what they were before; and you and your daughters will return to what you were before. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> You would not even mention your sister Sodom in the day of your pride, <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> before your wickedness was uncovered. Even so, you are now scorned by the daughters of Edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines-all those around you who despise you. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the LORD. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> \"'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will deal with you as you deserve, because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, both those who are older than you and those who are younger. I will give them to you as daughters, but not on the basis of my covenant with you. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> So I will establish my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Then, when I make atonement for you for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation, declares the Sovereign LORD.'\" "},{"_id":"61608c36a775948f9a152f09","topicId":"61608c33a775948f9a152efc","verse":"Ezekiel 3:1-27","votes":5,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p26003001_01-13\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v26003001-1\">3:1&nbsp;</b>And he said to me, “Son of man, eat whatever you find here.

He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He does not lend at usury or take excessive interest. He withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between man and man. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws. That man is righteous; he will surely live, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Suppose he has a violent son, who sheds blood or does any of these other things <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (though the father has done none of them): \"He eats at the mountain shrines. He defiles his neighbor's wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He oppresses the poor and needy. He commits robbery. He does not return what he took in pledge. He looks to the idols. He does detestable things. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He lends at usury and takes excessive interest. Will such a man live? He will not! Because he has done all these detestable things, he will surely be put to death and his blood will be on his own head. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"But suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits, and though he sees them, he does not do such things: <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor's wife. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan. He does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He withholds his hand from sin and takes no usury or excessive interest. He keeps my laws and follows my decrees. He will not die for his father's sin; he will surely live. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But his father will die for his own sin, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Yet you ask, 'Why does the son not share the guilt of his father?' Since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees, he will surely live. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"But if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> None of the offenses he has committed will be remembered against him. Because of the righteous things he has done, he will live. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"But if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked man does, will he live? None of the righteous things he has done will be remembered. Because of the unfaithfulness he is guilty of and because of the sins he has committed, he will die. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Yet you say, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear, O house of Israel: Is my way unjust? Is it not your ways that are unjust? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin, he will die for it; because of the sin he has committed he will die. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But if a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will save his life. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Because he considers all the offenses he has committed and turns away from them, he will surely live; he will not die. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Yet the house of Israel says, 'The way of the Lord is not just.' Are my ways unjust, O house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are unjust? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore, O house of Israel, I will judge you, each one according to his ways, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent! Turn away from all your offenses; then sin will not be your downfall. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign LORD. Repent and live! "}]}
