And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.  <strong>19</strong> And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.  <strong>20</strong> In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.  <strong>21</strong> So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.  <strong>22</strong> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.  <strong>23</strong> So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that  every one put them off for washing.

Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble-burned as they are?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, \"What they are building-if even a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Hear us, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, \"The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Also our enemies said, \"Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, \"Wherever you turn, they will attack us.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, \"Don't be afraid of them.

The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, \"The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> At that time I also said to the people, \"Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and workmen by day.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.
