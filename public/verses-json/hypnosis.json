Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!\"? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
