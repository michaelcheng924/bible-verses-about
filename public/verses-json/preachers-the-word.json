and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.  <strong>13</strong> And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.  <strong>14</strong> In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was  Nahshon the son of Amminadab.  <strong>15</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was  Nethaneel the son of Zuar.  <strong>16</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was  Eliab the son of Helon.  <strong>17</strong> And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.  <strong>18</strong> And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.  <strong>19</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.  <strong>20</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.  <strong>21</strong> And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.  <strong>22</strong> And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.  <strong>23</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was  Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.  <strong>24</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was  Abidan the son of Gideoni.  <strong>25</strong> And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.  <strong>26</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was  Pagiel the son of Ocran.  <strong>27</strong> And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was  Ahira the son of Enan.  <strong>28</strong> Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.  <strong>29</strong> And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.  <strong>30</strong> And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred.  <strong>31</strong> And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes.  <strong>32</strong> And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.  <strong>33</strong> And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.  <strong>34</strong> And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp.  <strong>35</strong> And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee.  <strong>36</strong> And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD said to Moses: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> If only one is sounded, the leaders-the heads of the clans of Israel-are to assemble before you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the same signal. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the LORD your God and rescued from your enemies. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Also at your times of rejoicing-your appointed feasts and New Moon festivals-you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the LORD your God.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They set out, this first time, at the LORD's command through Moses. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out, under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, \"We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He answered, \"No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Moses said, \"Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert, and you can be our eyes. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, \"Rise up, O LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whenever it came to rest, he said, \"Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel.\" "},{"_id":"616980aebda5ba8d737086d5","topicId":"616980acbda5ba8d737086cd","verse":"Revelation 21:19","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p66021019_01-8\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66021019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel.
