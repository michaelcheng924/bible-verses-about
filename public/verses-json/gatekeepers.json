Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother, and on his side are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11002023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, “God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life! <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11002024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>Now therefore as the LORD lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11002025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died.</p>\n<p id=\"p11002025_12-11\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11002026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>And to Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death.

And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.  <strong>14</strong> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.  <strong>15</strong> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that  all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.  <strong>18</strong> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.  <strong>19</strong> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.  <strong>20</strong> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,  say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  <strong>21</strong> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  <strong>22</strong> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  <strong>23</strong> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.  <strong>24</strong> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.  <strong>25</strong> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.  <strong>26</strong> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.  <strong>27</strong> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  <strong>28</strong> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <strong>29</strong> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.  <strong>30</strong> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.  <strong>31</strong> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.  <strong>32</strong> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.  <strong>33</strong> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.  <strong>34</strong> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  <strong>35</strong> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.  <strong>36</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.  <strong>37</strong> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.  <strong>38</strong> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.  <strong>39</strong> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.  <strong>40</strong> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  <strong>41</strong> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  <strong>42</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.  <strong>43</strong> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?  <strong>44</strong> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  <strong>45</strong> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.  <strong>46</strong> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"I am about to go the way of all the earth,\" he said. \"So be strong, show yourself a man, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.' <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me-what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.' <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He had reigned forty years over Israel-seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, \"Do you come peacefully?\" He answered, \"Yes, peacefully.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he added, \"I have something to say to you.You may say it,\" she replied. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"As you know,\" he said, \"the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.You may make it,\" she said. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he continued, \"Please ask King Solomon-he will not refuse you-to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Very well,\" Bathsheba replied, \"I will speak to the king for you.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have one small request to make of you,\" she said. \"Do not refuse me.\" The king replied, \"Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So she said, \"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> King Solomon answered his mother, \"Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him-after all, he is my older brother-yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request! <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And now, as surely as the LORD lives-he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised-Adonijah shall be put to death today!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> To Abiathar the priest the king said, \"Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, \"Go, strike him down!\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, \"The king says, 'Come out!'\" But he answered, \"No, I will die here.\" Benaiah reported to the king, \"This is how Joab answered me.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then the king commanded Benaiah, \"Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them-Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army-were better men and more upright than he. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD's peace forever.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land in the desert. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Shimei answered the king, \"What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.\" And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, \"Your slaves are in Gath.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> the king summoned Shimei and said to him, \"Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.' <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The king also said to Shimei, \"You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wrongdoing. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and killed him.

 <strong>26</strong> Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:  <strong>27</strong> To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles;

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to you from God our Father. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints-- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and who also told us of your love in the Spirit. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation-- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness-- <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.

 <strong>10</strong> We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.  <strong>11</strong> And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up.  <strong>12</strong> But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same  king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.  <strong>14</strong> And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;  <strong>15</strong> And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place.  <strong>16</strong> Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not finished.  <strong>17</strong> Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.  <strong>1</strong> Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.  <strong>2</strong> And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:  <strong>3</strong> In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore cubits;  <strong>4</strong> With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expences be given out of the king’s house:  <strong>5</strong> And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one to his place, and place them in the house of God.  <strong>6</strong> Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are  beyond the river, be ye far from thence:  <strong>7</strong> Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.  <strong>8</strong> Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, even  of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.  <strong>9</strong> And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:  <strong>10</strong> That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.  <strong>11</strong> Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this.  <strong>12</strong> And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.  <strong>13</strong> Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily.  <strong>14</strong> And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.  <strong>15</strong> And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.  <strong>16</strong> And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,  <strong>17</strong> And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.  <strong>18</strong> And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.

So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, \"Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, \"You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They hired counselors to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language., <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the rest of their associates-the judges and officials over the men from Tripolis, Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (This is a copy of the letter they sent him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your servants, the men of Trans-Euphrates: <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The king should know that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and the royal revenues will suffer. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place of rebellion from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The king sent this reply: To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates: Greetings. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The divisions of the gatekeepers: From the Korahites: Meshelemiah son of Kore, one of the sons of Asaph. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Meshelemiah had sons: Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth and Eliehoenai the seventh. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Obed-Edom also had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh and Peullethai the eighth. (For God had blessed Obed-Edom.) <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> His son Shemaiah also had sons, who were leaders in their father's family because they were very capable men. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed and Elzabad; his relatives Elihu and Semakiah were also able men. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All these were descendants of Obed-Edom; they and their sons and their relatives were capable men with the strength to do the work-descendants of Obed-Edom, 62 in all. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Meshelemiah had sons and relatives, who were able men-18 in all. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hosah the Merarite had sons: Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him the first), <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Hilkiah the second, Tabaliah the third and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and relatives of Hosah were 13 in all. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> These divisions of the gatekeepers, through their chief men, had duties for ministering in the temple of the LORD, just as their relatives had. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Lots were cast for each gate, according to their families, young and old alike. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The lot for the East Gate fell to Shelemiah. Then lots were cast for his son Zechariah, a wise counselor, and the lot for the North Gate fell to him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The lot for the South Gate fell to Obed-Edom, and the lot for the storehouse fell to his sons. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The lots for the West Gate and the Shalleketh Gate on the upper road fell to Shuppim and Hosah. Guard was alongside of guard: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> There were six Levites a day on the east, four a day on the north, four a day on the south and two at a time at the storehouse. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As for the court to the west, there were four at the road and two at the court itself. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> These were the divisions of the gatekeepers who were descendants of Korah and Merari. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Their fellow Levites were in charge of the treasuries of the house of God and the treasuries for the dedicated things. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The descendants of Ladan, who were Gershonites through Ladan and who were heads of families belonging to Ladan the Gershonite, were Jehieli, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> the sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel. They were in charge of the treasuries of the temple of the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> From the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites and the Uzzielites: <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Shubael, a descendant of Gershom son of Moses, was the officer in charge of the treasuries. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> His relatives through Eliezer: Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zicri his son and Shelomith his son. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Shelomith and his relatives were in charge of all the treasuries for the things dedicated by King David, by the heads of families who were the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and by the other army commanders. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Some of the plunder taken in battle they dedicated for the repair of the temple of the LORD. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And everything dedicated by Samuel the seer and by Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah, and all the other dedicated things were in the care of Shelomith and his relatives. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> From the Izharites: Kenaniah and his sons were assigned duties away from the temple, as officials and judges over Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> From the Hebronites: Hashabiah and his relatives-seventeen hundred able men-were responsible in Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the king's service. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> As for the Hebronites, Jeriah was their chief according to the genealogical records of their families. In the fortieth year of David's reign a search was made in the records, and capable men among the Hebronites were found at Jazer in Gilead. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jeriah had twenty-seven hundred relatives, who were able men and heads of families, and King David put them in charge of the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh for every matter pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.

 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "}]}
