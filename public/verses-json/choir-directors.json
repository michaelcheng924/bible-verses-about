He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then the angel said to me, \"The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.\"

parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:  <strong>3</strong> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.  <strong>4</strong> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.  <strong>5</strong> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:  <strong>6</strong> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:  <strong>7</strong> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:  <strong>8</strong> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.  <strong>9</strong> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.  <strong>10</strong> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;  <strong>11</strong> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.  <strong>12</strong> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.  <strong>13</strong> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.  <strong>14</strong> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.  <strong>15</strong> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.  <strong>16</strong> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.  <strong>17</strong> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.  <strong>18</strong> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.  <strong>19</strong> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?  <strong>20</strong> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?  <strong>21</strong> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;  <strong>22</strong> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:  <strong>23</strong> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,  <strong>24</strong> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.  <strong>25</strong> Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.  <strong>26</strong> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.  <strong>27</strong> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:  <strong>28</strong> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.  <strong>29</strong> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;  <strong>30</strong> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,  <strong>31</strong> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.  <strong>32</strong> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.  <strong>34</strong> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.  <strong>35</strong> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.  <strong>36</strong> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.  <strong>37</strong> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.  <strong>38</strong> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their  iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.  <strong>39</strong> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.  <strong>40</strong> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!  <strong>41</strong> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>42</strong> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.  <strong>43</strong> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:  <strong>44</strong> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.  <strong>45</strong> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.  <strong>46</strong> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.  <strong>47</strong> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.  <strong>48</strong> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.  <strong>49</strong> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. <strong>50</strong> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;  <strong>51</strong> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their  strength in the tabernacles of Ham:  <strong>52</strong> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  <strong>53</strong> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  <strong>54</strong> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to  this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.  <strong>55</strong> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.  <strong>56</strong> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:  <strong>57</strong> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.  <strong>58</strong> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.  <strong>59</strong> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:  <strong>60</strong> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which  he placed among men;  <strong>61</strong> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.  <strong>62</strong> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.  <strong>63</strong> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.  <strong>64</strong> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.  <strong>65</strong> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.  <strong>66</strong> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.  <strong>67</strong> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:  <strong>68</strong> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.  <strong>69</strong> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.  <strong>70</strong> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:  <strong>71</strong> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.  <strong>72</strong> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old- <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> They would not be like their forefathers- a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle; <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They spoke against God, saying, \"Can God spread a table in the desert? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens; <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues; <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland! <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They did not remember his power- the day he redeemed them from the oppressor, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility- a band of destroying angels. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs; <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> their priests were put to the sword, and their widows could not weep. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, as a man wakes from the stupor of wine. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> He beat back his enemies; he put them to everlasting shame. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> Then he rejected the tents of Joseph, he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim; <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth that he established forever. <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> He chose David his servant and took him from the sheep pens; <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people Jacob, of Israel his inheritance. <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> And David shepherded them with integrity of heart; with skillful hands he led them.

and is there knowledge in the most High?  <strong>12</strong> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.  <strong>13</strong> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.  <strong>14</strong> For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.  <strong>15</strong> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against  the generation of thy children.  <strong>16</strong> When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;  <strong>17</strong> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.  <strong>18</strong> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.  <strong>19</strong> How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.  <strong>20</strong> As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.  <strong>21</strong> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.  <strong>22</strong> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.  <strong>23</strong> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.  <strong>24</strong> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.  <strong>25</strong> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.  <strong>26</strong> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.  <strong>27</strong> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.  <strong>28</strong> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.  <strong>1</strong> O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?  <strong>2</strong> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.  <strong>3</strong> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.  <strong>4</strong> Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.  <strong>5</strong>             A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.  <strong>6</strong> But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.  <strong>7</strong> They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.  <strong>8</strong> They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.  <strong>9</strong> We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.  <strong>10</strong> O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?  <strong>11</strong> Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it  out of thy bosom.  <strong>12</strong> For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.  <strong>13</strong> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.  <strong>14</strong> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.  <strong>15</strong> Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.  <strong>16</strong> The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.  <strong>17</strong> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.  <strong>18</strong> Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.  <strong>19</strong> O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.  <strong>20</strong> Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.  <strong>21</strong> O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.  <strong>22</strong> Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.  <strong>23</strong> Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.  <strong>1</strong> Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.  <strong>2</strong> When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.  <strong>3</strong> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.  <strong>4</strong> I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:  <strong>5</strong> Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.  <strong>6</strong> For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.  <strong>7</strong> But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.  <strong>8</strong> For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them. <strong>9</strong> But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.  <strong>10</strong> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.  <strong>1</strong> In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.  <strong>2</strong> In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.  <strong>3</strong> There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.  <strong>4</strong> Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.  <strong>5</strong> The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.  <strong>6</strong> At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.  <strong>7</strong> Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?  <strong>8</strong> Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,  <strong>9</strong> When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.  <strong>10</strong> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.  <strong>11</strong> Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.  <strong>12</strong> He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.  <strong>1</strong> I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.  <strong>2</strong> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.  <strong>3</strong> I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.  <strong>4</strong> Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.  <strong>5</strong> I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.  <strong>6</strong> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.  <strong>7</strong> Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?  <strong>8</strong> Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?  <strong>9</strong> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.  <strong>10</strong> And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember  the years of the right hand of the most High.  <strong>11</strong> I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.  <strong>12</strong> I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.  <strong>13</strong> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so  great a God as our God?  <strong>14</strong> Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.  <strong>15</strong> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.  <strong>16</strong> The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.  <strong>17</strong> The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.  <strong>18</strong> The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.  <strong>19</strong> Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.  <strong>20</strong> Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.  <strong>1</strong> Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.  <strong>2</strong> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:  <strong>3</strong> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.  <strong>4</strong> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.  <strong>5</strong> For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:  <strong>6</strong> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:  <strong>7</strong> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:  <strong>8</strong> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.  <strong>9</strong> The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.  <strong>10</strong> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;  <strong>11</strong> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.  <strong>12</strong> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.  <strong>13</strong> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.  <strong>14</strong> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.  <strong>15</strong> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.  <strong>16</strong> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.  <strong>17</strong> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.  <strong>18</strong> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.  <strong>19</strong> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?  <strong>20</strong> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?  <strong>21</strong> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;  <strong>22</strong> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:  <strong>23</strong> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,  <strong>24</strong> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.  <strong>25</strong> Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.  <strong>26</strong> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.  <strong>27</strong> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:  <strong>28</strong> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.  <strong>29</strong> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;  <strong>30</strong> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,  <strong>31</strong> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.  <strong>32</strong> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.  <strong>34</strong> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.  <strong>35</strong> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.  <strong>36</strong> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.  <strong>37</strong> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.  <strong>38</strong> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their  iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.  <strong>39</strong> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.  <strong>40</strong> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!  <strong>41</strong> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>42</strong> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.  <strong>43</strong> How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:  <strong>44</strong> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.  <strong>45</strong> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.  <strong>46</strong> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.  <strong>47</strong> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.  <strong>48</strong> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.  <strong>49</strong> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. <strong>50</strong> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;  <strong>51</strong> And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their  strength in the tabernacles of Ham:  <strong>52</strong> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  <strong>53</strong> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  <strong>54</strong> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to  this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.  <strong>55</strong> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.  <strong>56</strong> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:  <strong>57</strong> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.  <strong>58</strong> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.  <strong>59</strong> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:  <strong>60</strong> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which  he placed among men;  <strong>61</strong> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.  <strong>62</strong> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.  <strong>63</strong> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.  <strong>64</strong> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.  <strong>65</strong> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.  <strong>66</strong> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.  <strong>67</strong> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:  <strong>68</strong> But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.  <strong>69</strong> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.  <strong>70</strong> He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:  <strong>71</strong> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.  <strong>72</strong> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)  <strong>9</strong> That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.  <strong>10</strong> For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.  <strong>11</strong> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.  <strong>12</strong> Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.  <strong>13</strong> This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.  <strong>14</strong> Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.  <strong>15</strong> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.  <strong>16</strong> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;  <strong>17</strong> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.  <strong>18</strong> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.  <strong>19</strong> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.  <strong>20</strong> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> both low and high, rich and poor alike: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me- <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him- <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough- <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> that he should live on forever and not see decay. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For all can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Their tombs will remain their houses forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had named lands after themselves. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But man, despite his riches, does not endure; he is like the beasts that perish. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings. Selah <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Like sheep they are destined for the grave, and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But God will redeem my life from the grave; he will surely take me to himself. Selah <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases; <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Though while he lived he counted himself blessed- and men praise you when you prosper- <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light of life. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
