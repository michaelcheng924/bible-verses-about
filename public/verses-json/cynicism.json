For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  <strong>2</strong> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,  <strong>3</strong> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  <strong>4</strong> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of  Baal.  <strong>5</strong> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <strong>6</strong> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.  <strong>7</strong> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded  <strong>8</strong> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  <strong>10</strong> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  <strong>11</strong> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  <strong>12</strong> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?  <strong>13</strong> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  <strong>14</strong> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them.  <strong>15</strong> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  <strong>16</strong> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  <strong>17</strong> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  <strong>18</strong> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.  <strong>20</strong> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  <strong>21</strong> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.  <strong>22</strong> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  <strong>23</strong> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  <strong>24</strong> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?  <strong>25</strong> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  <strong>26</strong> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  <strong>27</strong> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  <strong>28</strong> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.  <strong>29</strong> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.  <strong>30</strong> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  <strong>31</strong> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  <strong>32</strong> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  <strong>33</strong> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  <strong>34</strong> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  <strong>35</strong> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  <strong>36</strong> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.

I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me\"? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And what was God's answer to him? \"I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did.

Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You will say then, \"Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \"The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things.

He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: \"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, \"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, \"Don't cry.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They were all filled with awe and praised God. \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" they said. \"God has come to help his people.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> he sent them to the Lord to ask, \"Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When the men came to Jesus, they said, \"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So he replied to the messengers, \"Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> This is the one about whom it is written: \"'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: \"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and \"sinners.\"' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.Tell me, teacher,\" he said. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Simon replied, \"I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.You have judged correctly,\" Jesus said. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The other guests began to say among themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\" "},{"_id":"615bc629e4f8ad1e13fa8426","topicId":"615bc624e4f8ad1e13fa8415","verse":"Matthew 21:21","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40021021_01-17\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v40021021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>And Jesus answered them, <span class=\"woc\">“Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>21</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.

So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.  <strong>7</strong> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.  <strong>8</strong> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  <strong>9</strong> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was  good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was  vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.  <strong>10</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,  <strong>11</strong> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.  <strong>12</strong> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.  <strong>13</strong> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be  thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?  <strong>15</strong> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.  <strong>16</strong> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.  <strong>19</strong> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?  <strong>20</strong> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  <strong>21</strong> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.  <strong>22</strong> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.  <strong>23</strong> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.  <strong>24</strong> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.  <strong>25</strong> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.  <strong>26</strong> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.  <strong>27</strong> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.  <strong>28</strong> And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is  better than thou.  <strong>29</strong> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.  <strong>30</strong> Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.  <strong>31</strong> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.  <strong>32</strong> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.  <strong>33</strong> And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.  <strong>34</strong> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.  <strong>35</strong> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim-two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then he said to the Kenites, \"Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.\" So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, to the east of Egypt. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs-everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel: <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.\" Samuel was troubled, and he cried out to the LORD all that night. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, \"Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Samuel reached him, Saul said, \"The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD's instructions.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Samuel said, \"What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Saul answered, \"The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Stop!\" Samuel said to Saul. \"Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.Tell me,\" Saul replied. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Samuel said, \"Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"But I did obey the LORD,\" Saul said. \"I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But Samuel replied: \"Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Saul said to Samuel, \"I have sinned. I violated the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Samuel said to him, \"I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Samuel said to him, \"The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors-to one better than you. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then Samuel said, \"Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.\" Agag came to him confidently, thinking, \"Surely the bitterness of death is past.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But Samuel said, \"As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.\" And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God-- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong-- <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: \"The righteous will live by faith.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
