My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:  <strong>2</strong> And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.  <strong>3</strong> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.  <strong>4</strong> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?  <strong>5</strong> And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:  <strong>6</strong> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.  <strong>7</strong> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.  <strong>8</strong> Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!  <strong>9</strong> In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.  <strong>10</strong> Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.  <strong>11</strong> Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!  <strong>12</strong> And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have  no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.  <strong>15</strong> And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:  <strong>16</strong> But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.  <strong>17</strong> Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.  <strong>18</strong> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:  <strong>19</strong> That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it! <strong>20</strong> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!  <strong>21</strong> Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!  <strong>22</strong> Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:  <strong>23</strong> Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!  <strong>24</strong> Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is  stretched out still.  <strong>26</strong> And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:  <strong>27</strong> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:  <strong>28</strong> Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:  <strong>29</strong> Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.  <strong>30</strong> And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and  sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: \"Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> to those who say, \"Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come, so we may know it.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily! <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal thong is broken. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds.

","niv":"<sup><strong>15</strong></sup> After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became ill. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> On the seventh day the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, \"While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. \"Is the child dead?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" they replied, \"he is dead.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.
