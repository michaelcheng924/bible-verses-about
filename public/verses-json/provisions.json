","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\"--which means, \"God with us.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
