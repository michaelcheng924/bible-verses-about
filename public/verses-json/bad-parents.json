Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  <strong>18</strong> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  <strong>19</strong> For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.  <strong>20</strong> For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,  ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.  <strong>21</strong> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:  <strong>22</strong> Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:  <strong>23</strong> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:  <strong>24</strong> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.  <strong>25</strong> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you.

And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.  <strong>15</strong> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,  <strong>16</strong> And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?  <strong>18</strong> There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.  <strong>19</strong> And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. <strong>20</strong> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:  <strong>21</strong> Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.  <strong>22</strong> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not seeit.  <strong>23</strong> And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.  <strong>24</strong> For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part  under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.  <strong>25</strong> But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.  <strong>26</strong> And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.  <strong>27</strong> They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.  <strong>28</strong> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;  <strong>29</strong> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.  <strong>30</strong> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.  <strong>31</strong> In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.  <strong>32</strong> Remember Lot’s wife.  <strong>33</strong> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.  <strong>34</strong> I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.  <strong>35</strong> Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>36</strong> Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>37</strong> And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord?
