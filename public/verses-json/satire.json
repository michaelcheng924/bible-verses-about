understanding;  <strong>4</strong> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for  hid treasures;  <strong>5</strong> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.  <strong>6</strong> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.  <strong>7</strong> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.  <strong>8</strong> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.  <strong>9</strong> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.  <strong>10</strong> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;  <strong>11</strong> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding

ways of darkness;  <strong>14</strong> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;  <strong>15</strong> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:  <strong>16</strong> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;  <strong>17</strong> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.  <strong>18</strong> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.  <strong>19</strong> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.  <strong>20</strong> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.  <strong>21</strong> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
