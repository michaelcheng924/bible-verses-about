and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  <strong>9</strong> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:  <strong>10</strong> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  <strong>11</strong> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  <strong>13</strong> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  <strong>14</strong> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.  <strong>15</strong> And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.  <strong>16</strong> But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  <strong>17</strong> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  <strong>18</strong> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  <strong>19</strong> Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  <strong>20</strong> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  <strong>21</strong> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.  <strong>22</strong> By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.  <strong>23</strong> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.  <strong>24</strong> By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;  <strong>25</strong> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;  <strong>26</strong> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  <strong>27</strong> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  <strong>28</strong> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  <strong>29</strong> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land:  which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  <strong>30</strong> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  <strong>31</strong> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  <strong>32</strong> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:  <strong>33</strong> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,  <strong>34</strong> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.  <strong>35</strong> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:  <strong>36</strong> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  <strong>37</strong> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  <strong>38</strong> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  <strong>39</strong> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  <strong>40</strong> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This is what the ancients were commended for. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then John's disciples came and asked him, \"How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, \"My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> She said to herself, \"If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus turned and saw her. \"Take heart, daughter,\" he said, \"your faith has healed you.\" And the woman was healed from that moment. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When Jesus entered the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> he said, \"Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.\" But they laughed at him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> News of this spread through all that region. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, \"Have mercy on us, Son of David!\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, \"Do you believe that I am able to do this?Yes, Lord,\" they replied. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then he touched their eyes and said, \"According to your faith will it be done to you\"; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, \"See that no one knows about this.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, \"Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But the Pharisees said, \"It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then he said to his disciples, \"The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.\" "},{"_id":"615bc02ae4f8ad1e13fa8175","topicId":"615bc023e4f8ad1e13fa815f","verse":"Psalm 23:1-6","votes":7,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<h4 id=\"p19023001_06-23\" class=\"psalm-title\">A Psalm of David.</h4>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023001_06-23\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v19023001-1\">23:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-23\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes me lie down in green pastures.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-23\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me beside still waters.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-23\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He restores my soul.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-23\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me in paths of righteousness</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his name’s sake.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023004_06-23\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will fear no evil,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-23\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are with me;</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your rod and your staff,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they comfort me.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023005_06-23\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You prepare a table before me</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of my enemies;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-23\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;you anoint my head with oil;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cup overflows.</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-23\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of my life,</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-23\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-23\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forever.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  <strong>2</strong> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  <strong>3</strong> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  <strong>4</strong> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  <strong>5</strong> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  <strong>6</strong> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
