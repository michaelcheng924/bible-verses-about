Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, \"Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> His master replied, \"No. We won't go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites.

Where did you come from?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He answered, \"We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants-me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You are welcome at my house,\" the old man said. \"Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, \"Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The owner of the house went outside and said to them, \"No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Get up; let's go.\" But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Everyone who saw it said, \"Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt.

And they were offended at him.  <strong>4</strong> But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.  <strong>5</strong> And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.  <strong>6</strong> And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.  <strong>7</strong> And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;  <strong>8</strong> And commanded them that they should take nothing for their  journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their  purse:  <strong>9</strong> But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.  <strong>10</strong> And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.  <strong>11</strong> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.  <strong>12</strong> And they went out, and preached that men should repent.  <strong>13</strong> And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.  <strong>14</strong> And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  <strong>15</strong> Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.  <strong>16</strong> But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.  <strong>17</strong> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.  <strong>18</strong> For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.  <strong>19</strong> Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:  <strong>20</strong> For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.  <strong>21</strong> And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;  <strong>22</strong> And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.  <strong>24</strong> And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.  <strong>25</strong> And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.  <strong>26</strong> And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.  <strong>27</strong> And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,  <strong>28</strong> And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.  <strong>29</strong> And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.  <strong>30</strong> And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.  <strong>31</strong> And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.  <strong>32</strong> And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.  <strong>33</strong> And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.  <strong>34</strong> And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.  <strong>35</strong> And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:  <strong>36</strong> Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?  <strong>38</strong> He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.  <strong>39</strong> And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.  <strong>40</strong> And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.  <strong>41</strong> And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.  <strong>42</strong> And they did all eat, and were filled.  <strong>43</strong> And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.  <strong>44</strong> And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.  <strong>45</strong> And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.  <strong>46</strong> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.  <strong>47</strong> And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.  <strong>48</strong> And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.  <strong>49</strong> But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:  <strong>50</strong> For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.  <strong>51</strong> And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.  <strong>52</strong> For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.  <strong>53</strong> And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.  <strong>54</strong> And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,  <strong>55</strong> And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.  <strong>56</strong> And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Where did this man get these things?\" they asked. \"What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And he was amazed at their lack of faith. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> These were his instructions: \"Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Wear sandals but not an extra tunic. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They went out and preached that people should repent. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said to him, \"That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\" When they found out, they said, \"Five--and two fish.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They all ate and were satisfied, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> because they all saw him and were terrified. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.

And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  <strong>10</strong> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  <strong>11</strong> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  <strong>12</strong> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:  <strong>13</strong> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.  <strong>14</strong> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.  <strong>15</strong> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  <strong>16</strong> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  <strong>18</strong> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:  <strong>19</strong> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:  <strong>20</strong> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.  <strong>21</strong> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.  <strong>22</strong> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  <strong>23</strong> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.  <strong>24</strong> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;  <strong>25</strong> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  <strong>28</strong> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  <strong>30</strong> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.  <strong>31</strong> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:  <strong>32</strong> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>33</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>34</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>35</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>36</strong> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.  <strong>37</strong> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.  <strong>38</strong> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"My lords,\" he said, \"please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.No,\" they answered, \"we will spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-both young and old-surrounded the house. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They called to Lot, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and said, \"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Get out of our way,\" they replied. And they said, \"This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them.\" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The two men said to Lot, \"Do you have anyone else here-sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, \"Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!\" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, \"Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Lot said to them, \"No, my lords, please! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it-it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to him, \"Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.\" (That is why the town was called Zoar. ) <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from the LORD out of the heavens. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities-and also the vegetation in the land. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
