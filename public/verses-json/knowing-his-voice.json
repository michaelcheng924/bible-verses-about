For which of these do you stone me?\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"We are not stoning you for any of these,\" replied the Jews, \"but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus answered them, \"Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken-- <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> and many people came to him. They said, \"Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And in that place many believed in Jesus.

It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you.
