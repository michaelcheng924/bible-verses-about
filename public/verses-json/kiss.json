Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  <strong>10</strong> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  <strong>11</strong> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  <strong>13</strong> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  <strong>14</strong> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  <strong>15</strong> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  <strong>16</strong> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  <strong>17</strong> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  <strong>18</strong> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are  not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.  <strong>19</strong> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  <strong>20</strong> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  <strong>21</strong> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  <strong>22</strong> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  <strong>23</strong> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  <strong>24</strong> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  <strong>25</strong> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  <strong>26</strong> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  <strong>27</strong> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  <strong>28</strong> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  <strong>29</strong> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  <strong>30</strong> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  <strong>31</strong> What shall we then say to these things?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And she constrained us.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:  <strong>17</strong> The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.  <strong>18</strong> And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.  <strong>19</strong> And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,  <strong>20</strong> And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,  <strong>21</strong> And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.  <strong>22</strong> And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.  <strong>23</strong> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them  into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely:  <strong>24</strong> Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.  <strong>25</strong> And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them.  <strong>26</strong> And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.  <strong>27</strong> And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.  <strong>28</strong> But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.  <strong>29</strong> Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,  <strong>30</strong> And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  <strong>31</strong> And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  <strong>32</strong> And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.  <strong>33</strong> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their  stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.  <strong>34</strong> And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.  <strong>35</strong> And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.  <strong>36</strong> And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace.  <strong>37</strong> But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.  <strong>38</strong> And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.  <strong>39</strong> And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city.  <strong>40</strong> And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of  Lydia and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> He came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was a Jewess and a believer, but whose father was a Greek. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, \"Come over to Macedonia and help us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day on to Neapolis. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. \"If you consider me a believer in the Lord,\" she said, \"come and stay at my house.\" And she persuaded us. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, \"These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, \"In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!\" At that moment the spirit left her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> They brought them before the magistrates and said, \"These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But Paul shouted, \"Don't harm yourself! We are all here!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then brought them out and asked, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> They replied, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God--he and his whole family. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: \"Release those men.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The jailer told Paul, \"The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But Paul said to the officers: \"They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and encouraged them. Then they left.

Everything on earth will perish. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark-you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
