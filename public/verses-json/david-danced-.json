in irons, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He sent darkness and made the land dark- for had they not rebelled against his words? <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land; <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy; <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for- <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the LORD.
