Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  <strong>23</strong> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.  <strong>24</strong> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;  <strong>25</strong> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  <strong>28</strong> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  <strong>30</strong> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.  <strong>31</strong> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:  <strong>32</strong> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>33</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>34</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>35</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>36</strong> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.  <strong>37</strong> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.  <strong>38</strong> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"My lords,\" he said, \"please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.No,\" they answered, \"we will spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-both young and old-surrounded the house. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They called to Lot, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and said, \"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Get out of our way,\" they replied. And they said, \"This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them.\" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The two men said to Lot, \"Do you have anyone else here-sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, \"Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!\" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, \"Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Lot said to them, \"No, my lords, please! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it-it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to him, \"Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.\" (That is why the town was called Zoar. ) <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from the LORD out of the heavens. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities-and also the vegetation in the land. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.

 <strong>2</strong> And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  <strong>3</strong> And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>4</strong> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>5</strong> And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.  <strong>6</strong> But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. <strong>7</strong>           Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  <strong>8</strong> Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.  <strong>9</strong> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  <strong>10</strong> Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  <strong>12</strong> How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  <strong>22</strong> Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. <strong>23</strong>           Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.  <strong>24</strong> And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  <strong>25</strong> But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.  <strong>26</strong> The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>27</strong> Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.  <strong>28</strong> But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  <strong>29</strong> And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>30</strong> And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.  <strong>31</strong> So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.  <strong>32</strong> Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:  <strong>33</strong> Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  <strong>34</strong> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  <strong>35</strong> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He called a little child and had him stand among them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And he said: \"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come! <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, \"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart.\" "}]}
