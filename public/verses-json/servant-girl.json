This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. \"Man of God,\" he begged, \"please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants! <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, \"Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.\" So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He told the king, \"This is what the LORD says: Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?

But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.

I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness-- <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.

Jesus saith unto them, I amhe. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.  <strong>6</strong> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.  <strong>7</strong> Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>8</strong> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:  <strong>9</strong> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.  <strong>10</strong> Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.  <strong>11</strong> Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?  <strong>12</strong> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,  <strong>13</strong> And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.  <strong>14</strong> Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.  <strong>15</strong> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.  <strong>16</strong> But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.  <strong>17</strong> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.  <strong>18</strong> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.  <strong>19</strong> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.  <strong>20</strong> Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.  <strong>21</strong> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.  <strong>22</strong> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?  <strong>23</strong> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?  <strong>24</strong> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.  <strong>25</strong> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it,  and said, I am not.  <strong>26</strong> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?  <strong>27</strong> Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.  <strong>28</strong> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.  <strong>29</strong> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?  <strong>30</strong> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:  <strong>32</strong> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>33</strong> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?  <strong>35</strong> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  <strong>36</strong> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.  <strong>37</strong> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.  <strong>38</strong> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.  <strong>39</strong> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  <strong>40</strong> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I am he,\" Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Again he asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" And they said, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I told you that I am he,\" Jesus answered. \"If you are looking for me, then let these men go.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: \"I have not lost one of those you gave me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus commanded Peter, \"Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have spoken openly to the world,\" Jesus replied. \"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\" he demanded. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"If I said something wrong,\" Jesus replied, \"testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Pilate came out to them and asked, \"What charges are you bringing against this man?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"If he were not a criminal,\" they replied, \"we would not have handed him over to you.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Pilate said, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"But we have no right to execute anyone,\" the Jews objected. This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Is that your own idea,\" Jesus asked, \"or did others talk to you about me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Am I a Jew?\" Pilate replied. \"It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"You are a king, then!\" said Pilate. Jesus answered, \"You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"What is truth?\" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, \"I find no basis for a charge against him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They shouted back, \"No, not him! Give us Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.

And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.  <strong>5</strong> And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.  <strong>6</strong> And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.  <strong>7</strong> And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.  <strong>8</strong> Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;  <strong>10</strong> And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.  <strong>12</strong> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.  <strong>13</strong> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?  <strong>14</strong> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.  <strong>15</strong> Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.  <strong>16</strong> And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?  <strong>18</strong> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.  <strong>19</strong> When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.  <strong>20</strong> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.  <strong>21</strong> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.  <strong>22</strong> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.  <strong>23</strong> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  <strong>24</strong> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.  <strong>25</strong> Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.  <strong>26</strong> Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.  <strong>27</strong> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.  <strong>28</strong> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.  <strong>29</strong> And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it  upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!  <strong>30</strong> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.  <strong>31</strong> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.  <strong>32</strong> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.  <strong>33</strong> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,  <strong>34</strong> They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.  <strong>35</strong> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  <strong>36</strong> And sitting down they watched him there;  <strong>37</strong> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>38</strong> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.  <strong>39</strong> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,  <strong>40</strong> And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it  in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.  <strong>41</strong> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,  <strong>42</strong> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.  <strong>43</strong> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.  <strong>44</strong> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.  <strong>45</strong> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.  <strong>46</strong> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <strong>47</strong> Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.  <strong>48</strong> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  <strong>49</strong> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  <strong>51</strong> And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;  <strong>52</strong> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,  <strong>53</strong> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.  <strong>54</strong> Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.  <strong>55</strong> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  <strong>56</strong> Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.  <strong>57</strong> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:  <strong>58</strong> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.  <strong>59</strong> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  <strong>60</strong> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.  <strong>61</strong> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.  <strong>62</strong> Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  <strong>63</strong> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  <strong>64</strong> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.  <strong>65</strong> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it  as sure as ye can.  <strong>66</strong> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"I have sinned,\" he said, \"for I have betrayed innocent blood.What is that to us?\" they replied. \"That's your responsibility.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The chief priests picked up the coins and said, \"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Pilate asked him, \"Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \"Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: \"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\" asked the governor. \"Barabbas,\" they answered. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?\" Pilate asked. They all answered, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \"I am innocent of this man's blood,\" he said. \"It is your responsibility!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> All the people answered, \"Let his blood be on us and on our children!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" they said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> and saying, \"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The rest said, \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock.

And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.  <strong>3</strong> And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.  <strong>4</strong> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.  <strong>5</strong> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.  <strong>6</strong> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.  <strong>8</strong> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.  <strong>9</strong> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <strong>10</strong> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.  <strong>11</strong> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?  <strong>12</strong> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  <strong>13</strong> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.  <strong>14</strong> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.  <strong>15</strong> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.  <strong>16</strong> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:  <strong>17</strong> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.  <strong>18</strong> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.  <strong>19</strong> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  <strong>20</strong> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.  <strong>21</strong> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?  <strong>22</strong> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \"Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.\" Then she kissed them and they wept aloud <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and said to her, \"We will go back with you to your people.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But Naomi said, \"Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me-even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Look,\" said Naomi, \"your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Ruth replied, \"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, \"Can this be Naomi?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Don't call me Naomi, \"she told them. \"Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.

His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: \"Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever!

 <strong>10</strong> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.  <strong>11</strong> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.  <strong>12</strong> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.  <strong>13</strong> Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.  <strong>14</strong> And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.  <strong>15</strong> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.  <strong>16</strong> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?  <strong>17</strong> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.  <strong>18</strong> But it is good to be zealously affected always in a  good thing, and not only when I am present with you.  <strong>19</strong> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,  <strong>20</strong> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.  <strong>21</strong> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?  <strong>22</strong> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.  <strong>23</strong> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.  <strong>24</strong> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.  <strong>25</strong> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.  <strong>26</strong> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.  <strong>27</strong> For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.  <strong>28</strong> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.  <strong>29</strong> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.  <strong>30</strong> Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.  <strong>31</strong> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles?

I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you! <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For it is written: \"Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But what does the Scripture say? \"Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
