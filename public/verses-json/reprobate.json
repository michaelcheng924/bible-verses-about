For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.  <strong>9</strong> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.  <strong>10</strong> For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.  <strong>11</strong> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are  all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  <strong>12</strong> Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.  <strong>13</strong> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.  <strong>14</strong> Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  <strong>15</strong> And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  <strong>16</strong> For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.  <strong>17</strong> Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his  brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.  <strong>18</strong> For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.  <strong>1</strong> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;  <strong>2</strong> Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.  <strong>3</strong> For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.  <strong>4</strong> For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.  <strong>5</strong> And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;  <strong>6</strong> But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,  <strong>8</strong> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:  <strong>9</strong> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.  <strong>10</strong> Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.  <strong>11</strong> So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)  <strong>12</strong> Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.  <strong>13</strong> But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  <strong>14</strong> For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;  <strong>15</strong> While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.  <strong>16</strong> For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.  <strong>17</strong> But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?  <strong>18</strong> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?  <strong>19</strong> So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

(I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.  <strong>24</strong> Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.  <strong>25</strong> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;  <strong>26</strong> In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own  countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;  <strong>27</strong> In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.  <strong>28</strong> Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.  <strong>29</strong> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?  <strong>30</strong> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.  <strong>31</strong> The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.  <strong>32</strong> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:  <strong>33</strong> And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those \"super-apostles.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about. Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
