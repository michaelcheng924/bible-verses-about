Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
