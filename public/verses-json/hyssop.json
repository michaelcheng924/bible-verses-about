 <strong>2</strong> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.  <strong>3</strong> They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.  <strong>4</strong> For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto  prayer.  <strong>5</strong> And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.  <strong>6</strong> Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.  <strong>7</strong> When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.  <strong>8</strong> Let his days be few; and let another take his office.  <strong>9</strong> Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.  <strong>10</strong> Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.  <strong>11</strong> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.  <strong>12</strong> Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.  <strong>13</strong> Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.  <strong>14</strong> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.  <strong>15</strong> Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.  <strong>16</strong> Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.  <strong>17</strong> As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.  <strong>18</strong> As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.  <strong>19</strong> Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.  <strong>20</strong>             Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.  <strong>21</strong> But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.  <strong>22</strong> For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.  <strong>23</strong> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.  <strong>24</strong> My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.  <strong>25</strong> I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.  <strong>26</strong> Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:  <strong>27</strong> That they may know that this is thy hand; that  thou, LORD, hast done it.  <strong>28</strong> Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.  <strong>29</strong> Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.  <strong>30</strong> I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.  <strong>31</strong> For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him  from those that condemn his soul.  <strong>1</strong> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.  <strong>2</strong> The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.  <strong>3</strong> Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.  <strong>4</strong> The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.  <strong>5</strong> The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.  <strong>6</strong> He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places  with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.  <strong>7</strong> He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.  <strong>1</strong> Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.  <strong>2</strong> The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.  <strong>3</strong> His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.  <strong>4</strong> He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is  gracious and full of compassion.  <strong>5</strong> He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.  <strong>6</strong> He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.  <strong>7</strong> The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.  <strong>8</strong> They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.  <strong>9</strong> He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.  <strong>10</strong> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.  <strong>1</strong> Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.  <strong>2</strong> His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.  <strong>3</strong> Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.  <strong>4</strong> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is  gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.  <strong>5</strong> A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.  <strong>6</strong> Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.  <strong>7</strong> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.  <strong>8</strong> His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.  <strong>9</strong> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.  <strong>10</strong> The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.  <strong>1</strong> Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.  <strong>3</strong> From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’S name is to be praised.  <strong>4</strong> The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.  <strong>5</strong> Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,  <strong>6</strong> Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are  in heaven, and in the earth!  <strong>7</strong> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;  <strong>8</strong> That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.  <strong>9</strong> He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;  <strong>2</strong> Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.  <strong>3</strong> The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.  <strong>4</strong> The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.  <strong>5</strong> What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?  <strong>6</strong> Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?  <strong>7</strong> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;  <strong>8</strong> Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.  <strong>1</strong> Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake.  <strong>2</strong> Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?  <strong>3</strong> But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.  <strong>4</strong> Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.  <strong>5</strong> They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:  <strong>6</strong> They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:  <strong>7</strong> They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.  <strong>8</strong> They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.  <strong>9</strong> O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.  <strong>10</strong> O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.  <strong>11</strong> Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.  <strong>12</strong> The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.  <strong>13</strong> He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.  <strong>15</strong> Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.  <strong>16</strong> The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD’S: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.  <strong>17</strong> The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.  <strong>18</strong> But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.  <strong>2</strong> Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.  <strong>3</strong> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.  <strong>4</strong> Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.  <strong>5</strong> Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is  merciful.  <strong>6</strong> The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.  <strong>7</strong> Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.  <strong>8</strong> For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.  <strong>9</strong> I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.  <strong>10</strong> I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:  <strong>11</strong> I said in my haste, All men are liars.  <strong>12</strong> What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?  <strong>13</strong> I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.  <strong>15</strong> Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.  <strong>16</strong> O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.  <strong>17</strong> I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,  <strong>19</strong> In the courts of the LORD’S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.  <strong>2</strong> For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>2</strong> Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>3</strong> Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>4</strong> Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth  for ever.  <strong>5</strong> I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.  <strong>6</strong> The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?  <strong>7</strong> The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.  <strong>8</strong>             It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.  <strong>9</strong>             It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.  <strong>10</strong> All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.  <strong>11</strong> They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.  <strong>12</strong> They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.  <strong>13</strong> Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.  <strong>15</strong> The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  <strong>16</strong> The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.  <strong>17</strong> I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.  <strong>19</strong> Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and  I will praise the LORD:  <strong>20</strong> This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.  <strong>21</strong> I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.  <strong>22</strong> The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.  <strong>23</strong> This is the LORD’S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.  <strong>24</strong> This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.  <strong>25</strong> Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.  <strong>26</strong> Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.  <strong>28</strong> Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art  my God, I will exalt thee.  <strong>29</strong> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>1</strong> Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that  seek him with the whole heart.  <strong>3</strong> They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.  <strong>4</strong> Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.  <strong>5</strong> O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!  <strong>6</strong> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.  <strong>7</strong> I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.  <strong>8</strong> I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.  <strong>9</strong> Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto  according to thy word.  <strong>10</strong> With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.  <strong>11</strong> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.  <strong>12</strong> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>13</strong> With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.  <strong>14</strong> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as  in all riches.  <strong>15</strong> I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.  <strong>16</strong> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.  <strong>17</strong> Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.  <strong>18</strong> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.  <strong>19</strong> I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.  <strong>20</strong> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.  <strong>21</strong> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.  <strong>22</strong> Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.  <strong>23</strong> Princes also did sit and speak against me: but  thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.  <strong>24</strong> Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.  <strong>25</strong> My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.  <strong>26</strong> I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>27</strong> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.  <strong>28</strong> My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.  <strong>29</strong> Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.  <strong>30</strong> I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. <strong>31</strong> I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.  <strong>32</strong> I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.  <strong>33</strong> Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.  <strong>34</strong> Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.  <strong>35</strong> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.  <strong>36</strong> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.  <strong>37</strong> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.  <strong>38</strong> Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.  <strong>39</strong> Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are  good.  <strong>40</strong> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.  <strong>41</strong> Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.  <strong>42</strong> So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.  <strong>43</strong> And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.  <strong>44</strong> So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.  <strong>45</strong> And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.  <strong>46</strong> I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.  <strong>47</strong> And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.  <strong>48</strong> My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.  <strong>49</strong> Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.  <strong>50</strong> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.  <strong>51</strong> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.  <strong>52</strong> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.  <strong>53</strong> Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.  <strong>54</strong> Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.  <strong>55</strong> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.  <strong>56</strong> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  <strong>57</strong>             Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.  <strong>58</strong> I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.  <strong>59</strong> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.  <strong>60</strong> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.  <strong>61</strong> The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.  <strong>62</strong> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>63</strong> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.  <strong>64</strong> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>65</strong> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>66</strong> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.  <strong>67</strong> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.  <strong>68</strong> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.  <strong>69</strong> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  <strong>70</strong> Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.  <strong>71</strong>             It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.  <strong>72</strong> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.  <strong>73</strong> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  <strong>74</strong> They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.  <strong>75</strong> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  <strong>76</strong> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.  <strong>77</strong> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.  <strong>78</strong> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.  <strong>79</strong> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.  <strong>80</strong> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.  <strong>81</strong> My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.  <strong>82</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?  <strong>83</strong> For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.  <strong>84</strong> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  <strong>85</strong> The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.  <strong>86</strong> All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.  <strong>87</strong> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.  <strong>88</strong> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  <strong>89</strong> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.  <strong>90</strong> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.  <strong>91</strong> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.  <strong>92</strong> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.  <strong>93</strong> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.  <strong>94</strong> I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.  <strong>95</strong> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.  <strong>96</strong> I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.  <strong>97</strong> O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.  <strong>98</strong> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.  <strong>99</strong> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.  <strong>100</strong> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.  <strong>101</strong> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  <strong>102</strong> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.  <strong>103</strong> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!  <strong>104</strong> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  <strong>105</strong> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  <strong>106</strong> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  <strong>107</strong> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>108</strong> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  <strong>109</strong> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.  <strong>110</strong> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.  <strong>111</strong> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  <strong>112</strong> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.  <strong>113</strong> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.  <strong>114</strong> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.  <strong>115</strong> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.  <strong>116</strong> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  <strong>117</strong> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  <strong>118</strong> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.  <strong>119</strong> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.  <strong>120</strong> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  <strong>121</strong> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.  <strong>122</strong> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.  <strong>123</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.  <strong>124</strong> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>125</strong> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.  <strong>126</strong>             It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for  they have made void thy law.  <strong>127</strong> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.  <strong>128</strong> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning  all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  <strong>129</strong> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.  <strong>130</strong> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.  <strong>131</strong> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.  <strong>132</strong> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  <strong>133</strong> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  <strong>134</strong> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.  <strong>135</strong> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>136</strong> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  <strong>137</strong> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.  <strong>138</strong> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  <strong>139</strong> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  <strong>140</strong> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.  <strong>141</strong> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.  <strong>142</strong> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.  <strong>143</strong> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.  <strong>144</strong> The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.  <strong>145</strong> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.  <strong>146</strong> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  <strong>147</strong> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.  <strong>148</strong> Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  <strong>149</strong> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  <strong>150</strong> They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.  <strong>151</strong> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are  truth.  <strong>152</strong> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.  <strong>153</strong> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.  <strong>154</strong> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.  <strong>155</strong> Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.  <strong>156</strong> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.  <strong>157</strong> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet  do I not decline from thy testimonies.  <strong>158</strong> I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.  <strong>159</strong> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.  <strong>160</strong> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  <strong>161</strong> Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.  <strong>162</strong> I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.  <strong>163</strong> I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.  <strong>164</strong> Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>165</strong> Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.  <strong>166</strong> LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.  <strong>167</strong> My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.  <strong>168</strong> I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.  <strong>169</strong> Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.  <strong>170</strong> Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.  <strong>171</strong> My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.  <strong>172</strong> My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are  righteousness.  <strong>173</strong> Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.  <strong>174</strong> I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is  my delight.  <strong>175</strong> Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.  <strong>176</strong> I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.  <strong>1</strong> In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.  <strong>2</strong> Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.  <strong>3</strong> What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?  <strong>4</strong> Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.  <strong>5</strong> Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!  <strong>6</strong> My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.  <strong>7</strong> I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.  <strong>1</strong> I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.  <strong>2</strong> My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.  <strong>3</strong> He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.  <strong>4</strong> Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.  <strong>5</strong> The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand.  <strong>6</strong> The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.  <strong>7</strong> The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.  <strong>8</strong> The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.  <strong>1</strong> I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.  <strong>3</strong> Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:  <strong>4</strong> Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.  <strong>5</strong> For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.  <strong>6</strong> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.  <strong>7</strong> Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.  <strong>8</strong> For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be  within thee.  <strong>9</strong> Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.  <strong>1</strong> Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.  <strong>2</strong> Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.  <strong>3</strong> Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.  <strong>4</strong> Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.  <strong>1</strong> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;  <strong>2</strong> If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:  <strong>3</strong> Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:  <strong>4</strong> Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:  <strong>5</strong> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.  <strong>6</strong> Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.  <strong>7</strong> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.  <strong>8</strong> Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.  <strong>1</strong> They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which  cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.  <strong>2</strong> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.  <strong>3</strong> For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.  <strong>4</strong> Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.  <strong>5</strong> As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be  upon Israel.  <strong>1</strong> When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.  <strong>2</strong> Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.  <strong>3</strong> The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.  <strong>4</strong> Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.  <strong>5</strong> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.  <strong>6</strong> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him. <strong>1</strong> Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.  <strong>2</strong>             It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.  <strong>3</strong> Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.  <strong>4</strong> As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are  children of the youth.  <strong>5</strong> Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.  <strong>1</strong> Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.  <strong>2</strong> For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt  thou be, and it shall be well with thee.  <strong>3</strong> Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.  <strong>4</strong> Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.  <strong>5</strong> The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.  <strong>6</strong> Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, and peace upon Israel.  <strong>1</strong> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:  <strong>2</strong> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.  <strong>3</strong> The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.  <strong>4</strong> The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.  <strong>5</strong> Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.  <strong>6</strong> Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:  <strong>7</strong> Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.  <strong>8</strong> Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be  upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.  <strong>2</strong> Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.  <strong>3</strong> If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?  <strong>4</strong> But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.  <strong>5</strong> I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.  <strong>6</strong> My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.  <strong>7</strong> Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.  <strong>8</strong> And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.  <strong>1</strong> LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.  <strong>2</strong> Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.  <strong>3</strong> Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.  <strong>1</strong> LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions:  <strong>2</strong> How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;  <strong>3</strong> Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;  <strong>4</strong> I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,  <strong>5</strong> Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.  <strong>6</strong> Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.  <strong>7</strong> We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.  <strong>8</strong> Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.  <strong>9</strong> Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.  <strong>10</strong> For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.  <strong>11</strong> The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.  <strong>12</strong> If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.  <strong>13</strong> For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.  <strong>14</strong> This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.  <strong>15</strong> I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.  <strong>16</strong> I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.  <strong>17</strong> There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.  <strong>18</strong> His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.  <strong>1</strong> Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!  <strong>2</strong>             It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;  <strong>3</strong> As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even  life for evermore.  <strong>1</strong> Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which by night stand in the house of the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.  <strong>3</strong> The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.  <strong>1</strong> Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him,  O ye servants of the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,  <strong>3</strong> Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.  <strong>4</strong> For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.  <strong>5</strong> For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.  <strong>6</strong> Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.  <strong>7</strong> He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.  <strong>8</strong> Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.  <strong>9</strong>             Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.  <strong>10</strong> Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;  <strong>11</strong> Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:  <strong>12</strong> And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.  <strong>13</strong> Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.  <strong>14</strong> For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.  <strong>15</strong> The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.  <strong>16</strong> They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;  <strong>17</strong> They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.  <strong>18</strong> They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.  <strong>19</strong> Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:  <strong>20</strong> Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>2</strong> O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth  for ever.  <strong>3</strong> O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth  for ever.

they stumbled, and there was no one to help. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom and broke away their chains. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He sent forth his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Others went out on the sea in ships; they were merchants on the mighty waters. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They saw the works of the LORD, his wonderful deeds in the deep. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths; in their peril their courage melted away. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They reeled and staggered like drunken men; they were at their wits' end. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble, and he brought them out of their distress. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They were glad when it grew calm, and he guided them to their desired haven. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He turned rivers into a desert, flowing springs into thirsty ground, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and fruitful land into a salt waste, because of the wickedness of those who lived there. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs;

and sayest, Return, ye children of men.  <strong>4</strong> For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.  <strong>5</strong> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.  <strong>6</strong> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.  <strong>7</strong> For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.  <strong>8</strong> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins  in the light of thy countenance.  <strong>9</strong> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told. <strong>10</strong> The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.  <strong>11</strong> Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.  <strong>12</strong> So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our  hearts unto wisdom.  <strong>13</strong> Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.  <strong>14</strong> O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.  <strong>15</strong> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.  <strong>16</strong> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.  <strong>17</strong> And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.  <strong>1</strong> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  <strong>2</strong> I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.  <strong>3</strong> Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and  from the noisome pestilence.  <strong>4</strong> He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.  <strong>5</strong> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;  <strong>6</strong>             Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.  <strong>7</strong> A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.  <strong>8</strong> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.  <strong>9</strong> Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;  <strong>10</strong> There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.  <strong>11</strong> For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.  <strong>12</strong> They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.  <strong>13</strong> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.  <strong>14</strong> Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.  <strong>15</strong> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.  <strong>16</strong> With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.  <strong>1</strong>           It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:  <strong>2</strong> To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,  <strong>3</strong> Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.  <strong>4</strong> For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.  <strong>5</strong> O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.  <strong>6</strong> A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.  <strong>7</strong> When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:  <strong>8</strong> But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.  <strong>9</strong> For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  <strong>10</strong> But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  <strong>11</strong> Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and  mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.  <strong>12</strong> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.  <strong>13</strong> Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.  <strong>14</strong> They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;  <strong>15</strong> To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.  <strong>1</strong> The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.  <strong>2</strong> Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.  <strong>3</strong> The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.  <strong>4</strong> The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.  <strong>5</strong> Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.  <strong>1</strong> O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.  <strong>2</strong> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.  <strong>3</strong> LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?  <strong>4</strong>             How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?  <strong>5</strong> They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.  <strong>6</strong> They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.  <strong>7</strong> Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it. <strong>8</strong> Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?  <strong>9</strong> He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?  <strong>10</strong> He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? <strong>11</strong> The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.  <strong>12</strong> Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;  <strong>13</strong> That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.  <strong>14</strong> For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.  <strong>15</strong> But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.  <strong>16</strong> Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?  <strong>17</strong> Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.  <strong>18</strong> When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.  <strong>19</strong> In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.  <strong>20</strong> Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?  <strong>21</strong> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.  <strong>22</strong> But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.  <strong>23</strong> And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.  <strong>1</strong> O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.  <strong>2</strong> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.  <strong>3</strong> For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.  <strong>4</strong> In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.  <strong>5</strong> The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land. <strong>6</strong> O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.  <strong>7</strong> For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,  <strong>8</strong> Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:  <strong>9</strong> When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.  <strong>10</strong> Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:  <strong>11</strong> Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.  <strong>1</strong> O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.  <strong>2</strong> Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.  <strong>3</strong> Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.  <strong>4</strong> For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.  <strong>5</strong> For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.  <strong>6</strong> Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.  <strong>7</strong> Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.  <strong>8</strong> Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.  <strong>9</strong> O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.  <strong>10</strong> Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.  <strong>11</strong> Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.  <strong>12</strong> Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice  <strong>13</strong> Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.  <strong>1</strong> The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof. <strong>2</strong> Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.  <strong>3</strong> A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.  <strong>4</strong> His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.  <strong>5</strong> The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.  <strong>6</strong> The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.  <strong>7</strong> Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.  <strong>8</strong> Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.  <strong>9</strong> For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.  <strong>10</strong> Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.  <strong>11</strong> Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.  <strong>12</strong> Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.  <strong>1</strong> O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.  <strong>2</strong> The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.  <strong>3</strong> He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.  <strong>4</strong> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.  <strong>5</strong> Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.  <strong>6</strong> With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.  <strong>7</strong> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.  <strong>8</strong> Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together  <strong>9</strong> Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.  <strong>1</strong> The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between  the cherubims; let the earth be moved.  <strong>2</strong> The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.  <strong>3</strong> Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is  holy.  <strong>4</strong> The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.  <strong>5</strong> Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for  he is holy.  <strong>6</strong> Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.  <strong>7</strong> He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.  <strong>8</strong> Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.  <strong>9</strong> Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.  <strong>1</strong> Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.  <strong>2</strong> Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with singing.  <strong>3</strong> Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that  hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.  <strong>4</strong> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.  <strong>5</strong> For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.  <strong>1</strong> I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.  <strong>2</strong> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.  <strong>3</strong> I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.  <strong>4</strong> A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. <strong>5</strong> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.  <strong>6</strong> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.  <strong>7</strong> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.  <strong>8</strong> I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.  <strong>2</strong> Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.  <strong>3</strong> For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.  <strong>4</strong> My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.  <strong>5</strong> By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.  <strong>6</strong> I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.  <strong>7</strong> I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.  <strong>8</strong> Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.  <strong>9</strong> For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,  <strong>10</strong> Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.  <strong>11</strong> My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.  <strong>12</strong> But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.  <strong>13</strong> Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.  <strong>14</strong> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.  <strong>15</strong> So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.  <strong>16</strong> When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.  <strong>17</strong> He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.  <strong>18</strong> This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.  <strong>19</strong> For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;  <strong>20</strong> To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;  <strong>21</strong> To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;  <strong>22</strong> When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.  <strong>24</strong> I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.  <strong>25</strong> Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.  <strong>26</strong> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:  <strong>27</strong> But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.  <strong>28</strong> The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.  <strong>1</strong> Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless  his holy name.  <strong>2</strong> Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:  <strong>3</strong> Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;  <strong>4</strong> Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;  <strong>5</strong> Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.  <strong>6</strong> The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.  <strong>7</strong> He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.  <strong>8</strong> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.  <strong>9</strong> He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.  <strong>10</strong> He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  <strong>11</strong> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.  <strong>12</strong> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.  <strong>13</strong> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.  <strong>14</strong> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.  <strong>15</strong>             As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.  <strong>16</strong> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.  <strong>17</strong> But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;  <strong>18</strong> To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.  <strong>19</strong> The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.  <strong>20</strong> Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.  <strong>21</strong> Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.  <strong>22</strong> Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.  <strong>1</strong> Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.  <strong>2</strong> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:  <strong>3</strong> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:  <strong>4</strong> Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:  <strong>5</strong>             Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.  <strong>6</strong> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.  <strong>7</strong> At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.  <strong>8</strong> They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.  <strong>9</strong> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.  <strong>10</strong> He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.  <strong>11</strong> They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.  <strong>12</strong> By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which  sing among the branches.  <strong>13</strong> He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.  <strong>14</strong> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;  <strong>15</strong> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and  oil to make his face to shine, and bread which  strengtheneth man’s heart.  <strong>16</strong> The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;  <strong>17</strong> Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.  <strong>18</strong> The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and  the rocks for the conies.  <strong>19</strong> He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.  <strong>20</strong> Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. <strong>21</strong> The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.  <strong>22</strong> The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.  <strong>23</strong> Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.  <strong>24</strong> O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.  <strong>25</strong>             So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.  <strong>26</strong> There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom  thou hast made to play therein.  <strong>27</strong> These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.  <strong>28</strong>             That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.  <strong>29</strong> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.  <strong>30</strong> Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.  <strong>31</strong> The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.  <strong>32</strong> He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.  <strong>33</strong> I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.  <strong>34</strong> My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.  <strong>35</strong> Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.  <strong>2</strong> Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.  <strong>3</strong> Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.  <strong>4</strong> Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.  <strong>5</strong> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;  <strong>6</strong> O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.  <strong>7</strong> He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.  <strong>8</strong> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.  <strong>9</strong> Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;  <strong>10</strong> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:  <strong>11</strong> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:  <strong>12</strong> When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.  <strong>13</strong> When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;  <strong>14</strong> He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;  <strong>15</strong>             Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.  <strong>16</strong> Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.  <strong>17</strong> He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:  <strong>18</strong> Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:  <strong>19</strong> Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.  <strong>20</strong> The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.  <strong>21</strong> He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:  <strong>22</strong> To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.  <strong>23</strong> Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.  <strong>24</strong> And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.  <strong>25</strong> He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.  <strong>26</strong> He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.  <strong>27</strong> They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.  <strong>28</strong> He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.  <strong>29</strong> He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.  <strong>30</strong> Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.  <strong>31</strong> He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.  <strong>32</strong> He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.  <strong>33</strong> He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.  <strong>34</strong> He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,  <strong>35</strong> And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.  <strong>36</strong> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.  <strong>37</strong> He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was  not one feeble person among their tribes.  <strong>38</strong> Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.  <strong>39</strong> He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.  <strong>40</strong>             The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.  <strong>41</strong> He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.  <strong>42</strong> For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.  <strong>43</strong> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:  <strong>44</strong> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;  <strong>45</strong> That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is  good: for his mercy endureth for ever.  <strong>2</strong> Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?  <strong>3</strong> Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.  <strong>4</strong> Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto  thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;  <strong>5</strong> That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.  <strong>6</strong> We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.  <strong>7</strong> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even  at the Red sea.  <strong>8</strong> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.  <strong>9</strong> He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.  <strong>10</strong> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.  <strong>11</strong> And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.  <strong>12</strong> Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.  <strong>13</strong> They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:  <strong>14</strong> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.  <strong>15</strong> And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.  <strong>16</strong> They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.  <strong>18</strong> And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.  <strong>19</strong> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.  <strong>20</strong> Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.  <strong>21</strong> They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;  <strong>22</strong> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. <strong>24</strong> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:  <strong>25</strong> But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.  <strong>26</strong> Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:  <strong>27</strong> To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.  <strong>28</strong> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.  <strong>29</strong> Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.  <strong>30</strong> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.  <strong>31</strong> And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.  <strong>32</strong> They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:  <strong>33</strong> Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.  <strong>34</strong> They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:  <strong>35</strong> But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.  <strong>36</strong> And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.  <strong>37</strong> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,  <strong>38</strong> And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.  <strong>39</strong> Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.  <strong>40</strong> Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.  <strong>41</strong> And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.  <strong>42</strong> Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.  <strong>43</strong> Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.  <strong>44</strong> Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:  <strong>45</strong> And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.  <strong>46</strong> He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.  <strong>47</strong> Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.  <strong>48</strong> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
