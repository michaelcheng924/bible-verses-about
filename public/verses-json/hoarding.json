who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?  <strong>30</strong> They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.  <strong>31</strong> Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.  <strong>32</strong> At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.  <strong>33</strong> Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.  <strong>34</strong> Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.  <strong>35</strong> They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When you sit to dine with a ruler, note well what is before you, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Do not crave his delicacies, for that food is deceptive. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Do not wear yourself out to get rich; have the wisdom to show restraint. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Cast but a glance at riches, and they are gone, for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Do not eat the food of a stingy man, do not crave his delicacies; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> for he is the kind of man who is always thinking about the cost. \"Eat and drink,\" he says to you, but his heart is not with you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the rod, he will not die. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Buy the truth and do not sell it; get wisdom, discipline and understanding. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The father of a righteous man has great joy; he who has a wise son delights in him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> May your father and mother be glad; may she who gave you birth rejoice! <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> My son, give me your heart and let your eyes keep to my ways, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> for a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife is a narrow well. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Like a bandit she lies in wait, and multiplies the unfaithful among men. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly! <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"They hit me,\" you will say, \"but I'm not hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?\" "},{"_id":"61625b64b1c7c31277405db6","topicId":"61625b5cb1c7c31277405d9d","verse":"Proverbs 13:4","votes":9,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p20013004_01-27\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v20013004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing,</span><br><span id=\"p20013004_01-27\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the soul of the diligent is richly supplied.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>4</strong> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.
