Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.  <strong>2</strong> Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.  <strong>3</strong> I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.  <strong>4</strong> The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.  <strong>5</strong> The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.  <strong>6</strong> I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.  <strong>7</strong> For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.  <strong>8</strong> He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to me.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that  shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.  <strong>10</strong> Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves  about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled.

Because of your sins you were sold; because of your transgressions your mother was sent away. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When I came, why was there no one? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to ransom you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I clothe the sky with darkness and make sackcloth its covering.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Sovereign LORD has given me an instructed tongue, to know the word that sustains the weary. He wakens me morning by morning, wakens my ear to listen like one being taught. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The Sovereign LORD has opened my ears, and I have not been rebellious; I have not drawn back. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Because the Sovereign LORD helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore have I set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He who vindicates me is near. Who then will bring charges against me? Let us face each other! Who is my accuser? Let him confront me! <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> It is the Sovereign LORD who helps me. Who is he that will condemn me? They will all wear out like a garment; the moths will eat them up. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the word of his servant? Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. This is what you shall receive from my hand: You will lie down in torment. "}]}
