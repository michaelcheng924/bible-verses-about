And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.  <strong>15</strong> But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.  <strong>16</strong> And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.  <strong>17</strong> But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided  against a house falleth.  <strong>18</strong> If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.  <strong>19</strong> And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.  <strong>20</strong> But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you.  <strong>21</strong> When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:  <strong>22</strong> But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.  <strong>23</strong> He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.  <strong>24</strong> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.  <strong>25</strong> And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.  <strong>26</strong> Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked.  <strong>28</strong> But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it. <strong>29</strong> And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.  <strong>30</strong> For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.  <strong>31</strong> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.  <strong>32</strong> The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.  <strong>33</strong> No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.  <strong>34</strong> The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye  is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.  <strong>35</strong> Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness.  <strong>36</strong> If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light. <strong>37</strong> And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.  <strong>38</strong> And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.  <strong>39</strong> And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.  <strong>40</strong> Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?  <strong>41</strong> But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.  <strong>42</strong> But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.  <strong>43</strong> Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.  <strong>44</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them. <strong>45</strong> Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.  <strong>46</strong> And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.  <strong>47</strong> Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.  <strong>48</strong> Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.  <strong>49</strong> Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:  <strong>50</strong> That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;  <strong>51</strong> From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.  <strong>52</strong> Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.  <strong>53</strong> And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:  <strong>54</strong> Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

'\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then he said to them, \"Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Then the one inside answers, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But some of them said, \"By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: \"Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, \"Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He replied, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As the crowds increased, Jesus said, \"This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then the Lord said to him, \"Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> But give what is inside the dish to the poor, and everything will be clean for you. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> One of the experts in the law answered him, \"Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.' <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world, <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions, <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> waiting to catch him in something he might say.
