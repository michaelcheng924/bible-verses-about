Peter also was standing with them, warming himself. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have spoken openly to the world,\" Jesus replied. \"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\" he demanded. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"If I said something wrong,\" Jesus replied, \"testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Pilate came out to them and asked, \"What charges are you bringing against this man?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"If he were not a criminal,\" they replied, \"we would not have handed him over to you.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Pilate said, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"But we have no right to execute anyone,\" the Jews objected. This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Is that your own idea,\" Jesus asked, \"or did others talk to you about me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Am I a Jew?\" Pilate replied. \"It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"You are a king, then!\" said Pilate. Jesus answered, \"You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"What is truth?\" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, \"I find no basis for a charge against him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They shouted back, \"No, not him! Give us Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.

And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.  <strong>5</strong> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?  <strong>6</strong> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their  lips, but their heart is far from me.  <strong>7</strong> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  <strong>8</strong> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.  <strong>10</strong> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:  <strong>11</strong> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is  Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.  <strong>12</strong> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;  <strong>13</strong> Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. <strong>14</strong> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:  <strong>15</strong> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.  <strong>16</strong> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>17</strong> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.  <strong>18</strong> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;  <strong>19</strong> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?  <strong>20</strong> And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.  <strong>21</strong> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  <strong>22</strong> Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:  <strong>23</strong> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.  <strong>24</strong> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it:  but he could not be hid.  <strong>25</strong> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:  <strong>26</strong> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.  <strong>27</strong> But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.  <strong>28</strong> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.  <strong>29</strong> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.  <strong>30</strong> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.  <strong>31</strong> And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.  <strong>32</strong> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  <strong>34</strong> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,  that is, Be opened.  <strong>35</strong> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.  <strong>36</strong> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;  <strong>37</strong> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. ) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \"'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\") <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ). <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> People were overwhelmed with amazement. \"He has done everything well,\" they said. \"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\" "},{"_id":"61608859a775948f9a152db9","topicId":"61608857a775948f9a152db2","verse":"Matthew 26:52-54","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40026052_01-8\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v40026052-1\">52&nbsp;</b>Then Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woc\">“Put your sword back into its place.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  <strong>15</strong> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  <strong>16</strong> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <strong>17</strong>           Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  <strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <strong>21</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  <strong>24</strong> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <strong>25</strong> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  <strong>26</strong> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <strong>27</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  <strong>28</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  <strong>29</strong> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>30</strong> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>31</strong> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  <strong>32</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <strong>33</strong>           Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  <strong>34</strong> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  <strong>35</strong> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  <strong>36</strong> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  <strong>37</strong> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <strong>38</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  <strong>39</strong> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  <strong>40</strong> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.  <strong>41</strong> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  <strong>42</strong> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <strong>43</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  <strong>44</strong> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  <strong>45</strong> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  <strong>46</strong> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?

But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
