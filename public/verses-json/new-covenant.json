And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

The LORD will create a new thing on earth- a woman will surround a man.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"When I bring them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: 'The LORD bless you, O righteous dwelling, O sacred mountain.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> People will live together in Judah and all its towns-farmers and those who move about with their flocks. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"The days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will plant the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the offspring of men and of animals. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, and to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"In those days people will no longer say, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Instead, everyone will die for his own sin; whoever eats sour grapes-his own teeth will be set on edge. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The time is coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was a husband to them, \"declares the LORD. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time,\" declares the LORD. \"I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\" declares the LORD. \"For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says, he who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar- the LORD Almighty is his name: <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,\" declares the LORD, \"will the descendants of Israel ever cease to be a nation before me.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"The days are coming,\" declares the LORD, \"when this city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the LORD. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.\" ","modified":"2022-07-26T16:23:14.190Z"},{"_id":"6168cb283b32607a097c17ac","topicId":"6168cb213b32607a097c1794","verse":"Romans 8:1-4","votes":49,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p45008001_05-25\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v45008001-1\">8:1&nbsp;</b>There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do.
