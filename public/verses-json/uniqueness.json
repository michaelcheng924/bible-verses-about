Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  <strong>22</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "},{"_id":"616cd0e2e9d39d04b3b5fd82","topicId":"616cd0dee9d39d04b3b5fd7a","verse":"Psalm 118:22","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19118022_01-8\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19118022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone that the builders rejected</span><br><span id=\"p19118022_01-8\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has become the cornerstone.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>22</strong> The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \"Why do you look for the living among the dead? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then they remembered his words. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but they were kept from recognizing him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He asked them, \"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \"Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"What things?\" he asked. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and he took it and ate it in their presence. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He said to them, \"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He told them, \"This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> You are witnesses of these things. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.

And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>9</strong> And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.  <strong>11</strong> Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.  <strong>12</strong> Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.  <strong>13</strong> They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.  <strong>14</strong> And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.  <strong>15</strong> But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience. <strong>16</strong>           No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.  <strong>17</strong> For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.  <strong>18</strong> Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have. <strong>19</strong> Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.  <strong>20</strong> And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.  <strong>21</strong> And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it. <strong>22</strong> Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.  <strong>23</strong> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.  <strong>24</strong> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.  <strong>25</strong> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.  <strong>26</strong> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.  <strong>27</strong> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.  <strong>28</strong> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.  <strong>29</strong> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.  <strong>31</strong> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.  <strong>32</strong> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.  <strong>33</strong> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.  <strong>34</strong> When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.  <strong>35</strong> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  <strong>36</strong> They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.  <strong>37</strong> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.  <strong>38</strong> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,  <strong>39</strong> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.  <strong>40</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.  <strong>41</strong> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:  <strong>42</strong> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.  <strong>43</strong> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,  <strong>44</strong> Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.  <strong>45</strong> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  <strong>46</strong> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.  <strong>47</strong> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. <strong>49</strong> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.  <strong>50</strong> But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.  <strong>51</strong> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.  <strong>52</strong> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.  <strong>53</strong> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.  <strong>54</strong> And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.  <strong>55</strong> And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.  <strong>56</strong> And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.\" When he said this, he called out, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> His disciples asked him what this parable meant. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He said, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, \"'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He replied, \"My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> One day Jesus said to his disciples, \"Let's go over to the other side of the lake.\" So they got into a boat and set out. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we're going to drown!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. \"Where is your faith?\" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, \"Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Legion,\" he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Return home and tell how much God has done for you.\" So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" he said. \"Don't bother the teacher any more.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \"Stop wailing,\" Jesus said. \"She is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> But he took her by the hand and said, \"My child, get up!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
