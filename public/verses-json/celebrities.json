But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!  <strong>25</strong> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>26</strong> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.  <strong>28</strong> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,  <strong>30</strong> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.  <strong>31</strong> But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. <strong>32</strong> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,  <strong>33</strong> Saying,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:  <strong>34</strong> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. <strong>35</strong> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.  <strong>36</strong> And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?  <strong>37</strong> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.  <strong>38</strong> But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  <strong>39</strong> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  <strong>40</strong> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.  <strong>41</strong> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.  <strong>42</strong> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  <strong>43</strong> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:  <strong>44</strong> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.  <strong>45</strong> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <strong>46</strong> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.  <strong>47</strong> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>48</strong> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>49</strong> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  <strong>50</strong> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  <strong>52</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"What did Moses command you?\" he replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They said, \"Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He answered, \"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, \"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \"Good teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good--except God alone. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" he declared, \"all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \"Who then can be saved?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Peter said to him, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus replied, \"no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"We are going up to Jerusalem,\" he said, \"and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" he asked. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They replied, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You don't know what you are asking,\" Jesus said. \"Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We can,\" they answered. Jesus said to them, \"You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" So they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, \"Rabbi, I want to see.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"Go,\" said Jesus, \"your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

I will not go in.  <strong>12</strong> And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.  <strong>14</strong> My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.  <strong>15</strong> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof,  and all the heathen that were about us saw these things,  they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.  <strong>17</strong> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.  <strong>18</strong> For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.  <strong>19</strong> Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.  <strong>1</strong> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,  <strong>2</strong> That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.  <strong>3</strong> And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.  <strong>4</strong> Now the city was large and great: but the people were  few therein, and the houses were not builded.

 <strong>2</strong> But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.  <strong>3</strong> But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:  <strong>4</strong> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.  <strong>5</strong> For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.  <strong>6</strong> For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.  <strong>7</strong> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.  <strong>8</strong> We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are  perplexed, but not in despair;  <strong>9</strong> Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;  <strong>10</strong> Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.  <strong>11</strong> For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.  <strong>12</strong> So then death worketh in us, but life in you.  <strong>13</strong> We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;  <strong>14</strong> Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.  <strong>15</strong> For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.  <strong>16</strong> For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.  <strong>17</strong> For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;  <strong>18</strong> While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.  <strong>1</strong> For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.  <strong>2</strong> For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:  <strong>3</strong> If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.  <strong>4</strong> For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.  <strong>5</strong> Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.  <strong>6</strong> Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:  <strong>7</strong> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)  <strong>8</strong> We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.  <strong>9</strong> Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.  <strong>10</strong> For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.  <strong>11</strong> Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.  <strong>12</strong> For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.  <strong>13</strong> For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.  <strong>14</strong> For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:  <strong>15</strong> And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.  <strong>16</strong> Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.  <strong>18</strong> And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;  <strong>19</strong> To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.  <strong>20</strong> Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God.  <strong>21</strong> For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.  <strong>1</strong> We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.  <strong>2</strong> (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)  <strong>3</strong> Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:  <strong>4</strong> But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,  <strong>5</strong> In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;  <strong>6</strong> By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,  <strong>7</strong> By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,  <strong>8</strong> By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;  <strong>9</strong> As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;  <strong>10</strong> As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.  <strong>11</strong> O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.  <strong>12</strong> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.  <strong>13</strong> Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.  <strong>14</strong> Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?  <strong>15</strong> And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  <strong>16</strong> And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.  <strong>17</strong> Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,  <strong>18</strong> And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.

The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  <strong>17</strong> For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.  <strong>18</strong> Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?  <strong>19</strong> What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?  <strong>20</strong> But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.  <strong>21</strong> Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils.  <strong>22</strong> Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?  <strong>23</strong> All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.  <strong>24</strong> Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s wealth.  <strong>25</strong> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:  <strong>26</strong> For the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.  <strong>27</strong> If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.  <strong>28</strong> But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof:  <strong>29</strong> Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man’s conscience?  <strong>30</strong> For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?  <strong>31</strong> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.  <strong>32</strong> Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:  <strong>33</strong> Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They all ate the same spiritual food <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered over the desert. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: \"The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did--and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> We should not test the Lord, as some of them did--and were killed by snakes. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And do not grumble, as some of them did--and were killed by the destroying angel. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is beneficial. \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is constructive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> for, \"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if anyone says to you, \"This has been offered in sacrifice,\" then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake-- <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God-- <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.

The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.  <strong>10</strong> And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and  the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.  <strong>11</strong> And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.  <strong>12</strong> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.  <strong>13</strong> These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.  <strong>14</strong> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.  <strong>15</strong> And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.  <strong>16</strong> And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.  <strong>17</strong> For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.  <strong>18</strong> And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.  <strong>1</strong> And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.  <strong>2</strong> And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.  <strong>3</strong> For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.  <strong>4</strong> And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.  <strong>5</strong> For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.  <strong>6</strong> Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  <strong>7</strong> How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.  <strong>8</strong> Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is  the Lord God who judgeth her.  <strong>9</strong> And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,  <strong>10</strong> Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.  <strong>11</strong> And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:  <strong>12</strong> The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,  <strong>13</strong> And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.  <strong>14</strong> And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.  <strong>15</strong> The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,  <strong>16</strong> And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!  <strong>17</strong> For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  <strong>18</strong> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!  <strong>19</strong> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.  <strong>20</strong> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.  <strong>21</strong> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <strong>22</strong> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <strong>23</strong> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  <strong>24</strong> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.

There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> This title was written on her forehead: MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When I saw her, I was greatly astonished. Then the angel said to me: \"Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then the angel said to me, \"The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.\" "},{"_id":"615a4c50a2008c08a2957434","topicId":"615a4c4ba2008c08a2957425","verse":"Revelation 8:1-13","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p66008001_08-17\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v66008001-1\">8:1&nbsp;</b>When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66008002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66008003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66008004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66008005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p66008005_11-17\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66008006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.</p>\n<p id=\"p66008006_11-17\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66008007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth.

but be filled with the Spirit;  <strong>19</strong> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;  <strong>20</strong> Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;  <strong>21</strong> Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.  <strong>22</strong> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  <strong>23</strong> For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.  <strong>25</strong> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;  <strong>26</strong> That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,  <strong>27</strong> That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  <strong>28</strong> So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  <strong>29</strong> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:  <strong>30</strong> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  <strong>31</strong> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  <strong>32</strong> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.  <strong>33</strong> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> There is one body and one Spirit--just as you were called to one hope when you were called-- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> one Lord, one faith, one baptism; "}]}
