And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them.

Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  <strong>34</strong> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  <strong>35</strong> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  <strong>36</strong> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  <strong>37</strong> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <strong>38</strong> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  <strong>39</strong> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  <strong>40</strong> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  <strong>41</strong> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  <strong>42</strong> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  <strong>43</strong> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  <strong>44</strong> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  <strong>45</strong> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>46</strong> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  <strong>47</strong> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  <strong>48</strong> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.

Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.  <strong>4</strong> And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.  <strong>5</strong> And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.  <strong>6</strong> And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.  <strong>7</strong> And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;  <strong>8</strong> And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.  <strong>9</strong> Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,  <strong>10</strong> And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.  <strong>11</strong> Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.  <strong>12</strong> And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.  <strong>13</strong> And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.  <strong>14</strong> But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.  <strong>15</strong> And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.  <strong>16</strong> And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:  <strong>17</strong> Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.  <strong>18</strong> And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day  they lightened the ship;  <strong>19</strong> And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.  <strong>20</strong> And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.  <strong>21</strong> But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.  <strong>22</strong> And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.  <strong>23</strong> For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,  <strong>24</strong> Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.  <strong>25</strong> Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.  <strong>26</strong> Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.  <strong>27</strong> But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;  <strong>28</strong> And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.  <strong>29</strong> Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.  <strong>30</strong> And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,  <strong>31</strong> Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.  <strong>32</strong> Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.  <strong>33</strong> And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.  <strong>34</strong> Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.  <strong>35</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.  <strong>36</strong> Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some  meat.  <strong>37</strong> And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.  <strong>38</strong> And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.  <strong>39</strong> And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.  <strong>40</strong> And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves  unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.  <strong>41</strong> And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.  <strong>42</strong> And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.  <strong>43</strong> But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their  purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:  <strong>44</strong> And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. So Paul warned them, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the \"northeaster,\" swept down from the island. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: \"Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.' <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, \"Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. \"For the last fourteen days,\" he said, \"you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven't eaten anything. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Altogether there were 276 of us on board. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety.
