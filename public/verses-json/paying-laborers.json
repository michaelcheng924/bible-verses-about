He forgave us all our sins, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!\"? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.

have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away

They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"6168f4ef803fbb813a70a8e9","topicId":"6168f4ed803fbb813a70a8e4","verse":"Numbers 7:1-89","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p04007001_06-5\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v04007001-1\">7:1&nbsp;</b>On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v04007002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>the chiefs of Israel, heads of their fathers’ houses, who were the chiefs of the tribes, who were over those who were listed, approached <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v04007003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>and brought their offerings before the LORD, six wagons and twelve oxen, a wagon for every two of the chiefs, and for each one an ox.

 <strong>46</strong> Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.  <strong>47</strong> But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.  <strong>48</strong> For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,  <strong>49</strong> Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:  <strong>50</strong> But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.  <strong>51</strong> And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.  <strong>52</strong> And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.  <strong>53</strong> But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.  <strong>54</strong> And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You and Aaron are to number by their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> One man from each tribe, each the head of his family, is to help you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> These are the names of the men who are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon; <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur; <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni; <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel; <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> These were the men appointed from the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the clans of Israel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been given, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people indicated their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai: <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Reuben was 46,500. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the descendants of Simeon: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were counted and listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Simeon was 59,300. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Gad was 45,650. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Issachar was 54,400. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Manasseh was 32,200. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> From the descendants of Benjamin: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> From the descendants of Dan: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Dan was 62,700. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> From the descendants of Asher: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel's army were counted according to their families. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The total number was 603,550. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The families of the tribe of Levi, however, were not counted along with the others. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The LORD had said to Moses: <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony-over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who goes near it shall be put to death. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his own standard. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the Testimony so that wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses. "}]}
