","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen-the work of a skilled craftsman. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Its skillfully woven waistband was like it-of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> They fashioned the breastpiece-the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> It was square-a span long and a span wide-and folded double. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. In the first row there was a ruby, a topaz and a beryl; <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire and an emerald; <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> in the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a jasper. They were mounted in gold filigree settings. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod-as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth-the work of a weaver- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar, and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen-the work of a weaver- <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and the turban of fine linen, the linen headbands and the undergarments of finely twisted linen. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The sash was of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn-the work of an embroiderer-as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They made the plate, the sacred diadem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So all the work on the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of hides of sea cows and the shielding curtain; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> the ark of the Testimony with its poles and the atonement cover; <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence; <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the oil for the light; <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting; <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD had commanded.

Fasten the ephod on him by its skillfully woven waistband. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Put the turban on his head and attach the sacred diadem to the turban. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Take the anointing oil and anoint him by pouring it on his head. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Bring his sons and dress them in tunics <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> and put headbands on them.

Then sprinkle blood against the altar on all sides. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And take some of the blood on the altar and some of the anointing oil and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments.

But no one else may eat them, because they are sacred. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And if any of the meat of the ordination ram or any bread is left over till morning, burn it up. It must not be eaten, because it is sacred. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Do for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Sacrifice a bull each day as a sin offering to make atonement. Purify the altar by making atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> For seven days make atonement for the altar and consecrate it. Then the altar will be most holy, and whatever touches it will be holy. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"This is what you are to offer on the altar regularly each day: two lambs a year old. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Offer one in the morning and the other at twilight. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With the first lamb offer a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives, and a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Sacrifice the other lamb at twilight with the same grain offering and its drink offering as in the morning-a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"For the generations to come this burnt offering is to be made regularly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before the LORD.

All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and who also told us of your love in the Spirit. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation-- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness-- <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.
