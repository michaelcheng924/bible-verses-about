By no means! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

I will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Among the prophets of Samaria I saw this repulsive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible: They commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns from his wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD Almighty says concerning the prophets: \"I will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water, because from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They keep saying to those who despise me, 'The LORD says: You will have peace.' And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, 'No harm will come to you.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand it clearly. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Am I only a God nearby,\" declares the LORD, \"and not a God far away? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see him?\" declares the LORD. \"Do not I fill heaven and earth?\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their fathers forgot my name through Baal worship. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Is not my word like fire,\" declares the LORD, \"and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore,\" declares the LORD, \"I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Yes,\" declares the LORD, \"I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, 'The LORD declares.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,\" declares the LORD. \"They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, 'What is the oracle of the LORD?' say to them, 'What oracle? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> This is what each of you keeps on saying to his friend or relative: 'What is the LORD's answer?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But you must not mention 'the oracle of the LORD 'again, because every man's own word becomes his oracle and so you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> This is what you keep saying to a prophet: 'What is the LORD's answer to you?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Although you claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' this is what the LORD says: You used the words, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' even though I told you that you must not claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your fathers. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> I will bring upon you everlasting disgrace-everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.\" "},{"_id":"6168b7373b32607a097c0ede","topicId":"6168b72f3b32607a097c0ec5","verse":"Revelation 12:11","votes":6,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p66012011_01-28\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66012011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>11</strong> And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
