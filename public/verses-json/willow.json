For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Yet it was the LORD's will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.

<strong>2</strong> Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that  seek him with the whole heart.  <strong>3</strong> They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.  <strong>4</strong> Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.  <strong>5</strong> O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!  <strong>6</strong> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.  <strong>7</strong> I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.  <strong>8</strong> I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.  <strong>9</strong> Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto  according to thy word.  <strong>10</strong> With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.  <strong>11</strong> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.  <strong>12</strong> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>13</strong> With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.  <strong>14</strong> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as  in all riches.  <strong>15</strong> I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.  <strong>16</strong> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.  <strong>17</strong> Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.  <strong>18</strong> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.  <strong>19</strong> I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.  <strong>20</strong> My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.  <strong>21</strong> Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.  <strong>22</strong> Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.  <strong>23</strong> Princes also did sit and speak against me: but  thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.  <strong>24</strong> Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.  <strong>25</strong> My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.  <strong>26</strong> I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>27</strong> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.  <strong>28</strong> My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.  <strong>29</strong> Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.  <strong>30</strong> I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. <strong>31</strong> I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.  <strong>32</strong> I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.  <strong>33</strong> Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.  <strong>34</strong> Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.  <strong>35</strong> Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.  <strong>36</strong> Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.  <strong>37</strong> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.  <strong>38</strong> Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.  <strong>39</strong> Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are  good.  <strong>40</strong> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.  <strong>41</strong> Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.  <strong>42</strong> So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.  <strong>43</strong> And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.  <strong>44</strong> So shall I keep thy

ashamed.  <strong>47</strong> And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.  <strong>48</strong> My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.  <strong>49</strong> Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.  <strong>50</strong> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.  <strong>51</strong> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.  <strong>52</strong> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.  <strong>53</strong> Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.  <strong>54</strong> Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.  <strong>55</strong> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.  <strong>56</strong> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  <strong>57</strong>             Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.  <strong>58</strong> I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.  <strong>59</strong> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.  <strong>60</strong> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.  <strong>61</strong> The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.  <strong>62</strong> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>63</strong> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.  <strong>64</strong> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>65</strong> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>66</strong> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.  <strong>67</strong> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.  <strong>68</strong> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.  <strong>69</strong> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  <strong>70</strong> Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.  <strong>71</strong>             It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.  <strong>72</strong> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.  <strong>73</strong> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  <strong>74</strong> They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.  <strong>75</strong> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  <strong>76</strong> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.  <strong>77</strong> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.  <strong>78</strong> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.  <strong>79</strong> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.  <strong>80</strong> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.  <strong>81</strong> My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.  <strong>82</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?  <strong>83</strong> For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.  <strong>84</strong> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  <strong>85</strong> The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.  <strong>86</strong> All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.  <strong>87</strong> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.  <strong>88</strong> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  <strong>89</strong> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.  <strong>90</strong> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.  <strong>91</strong> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.  <strong>92</strong> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.  <strong>93</strong> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.  <strong>94</strong> I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.  <strong>95</strong> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.  <strong>96</strong> I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.  <strong>97</strong> O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.  <strong>98</strong> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.  <strong>99</strong> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.  <strong>100</strong> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.  <strong>101</strong> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  <strong>102</strong> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.  <strong>103</strong> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!  <strong>104</strong> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  <strong>105</strong> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  <strong>106</strong> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  <strong>107</strong> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>108</strong> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  <strong>109</strong> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.  <strong>110</strong> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.  <strong>111</strong> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  <strong>112</strong> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.  <strong>113</strong> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.  <strong>114</strong> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.  <strong>115</strong> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.  <strong>116</strong> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  <strong>117</strong> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  <strong>118</strong> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.  <strong>119</strong> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.  <strong>120</strong> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  <strong>121</strong> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.  <strong>122</strong> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.  <strong>123</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.  <strong>124</strong> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>125</strong> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.  <strong>126</strong>             It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for  they have made void thy law.  <strong>127</strong> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.  <strong>128</strong> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning  all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  <strong>129</strong> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.  <strong>130</strong> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.  <strong>131</strong> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.  <strong>132</strong> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  <strong>133</strong> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  <strong>134</strong> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.  <strong>135</strong> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>136</strong> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  <strong>137</strong> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.  <strong>138</strong> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  <strong>139</strong> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  <strong>140</strong> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.  <strong>141</strong> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.  <strong>142</strong> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.  <strong>143</strong> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.  <strong>144</strong> The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.  <strong>145</strong> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.  <strong>146</strong> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  <strong>147</strong> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.  <strong>148</strong> Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  <strong>149</strong> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  <strong>150</strong> They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.  <strong>151</strong> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are  truth.  <strong>152</strong> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.  <strong>153</strong> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.  <strong>154</strong> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.  <strong>155</strong> Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.  <strong>156</strong> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.  <strong>157</strong> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet  do I not decline from thy testimonies.  <strong>158</strong> I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.  <strong>159</strong> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.  <strong>160</strong> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  <strong>161</strong> Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.  <strong>162</strong> I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.  <strong>163</strong> I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.  <strong>164</strong> Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>165</strong> Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.  <strong>166</strong> LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.  <strong>167</strong> My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.  <strong>168</strong> I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.  <strong>169</strong> Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.  <strong>170</strong> Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.  <strong>171</strong> My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.  <strong>172</strong> My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are  righteousness.  <strong>173</strong> Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.  <strong>174</strong>

preserve my life according to your promise. <sup><strong>155</strong></sup> Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek out your decrees. <sup><strong>156</strong></sup> Your compassion is great, O LORD; preserve my life according to your laws. <sup><strong>157</strong></sup> Many are the foes who persecute me, but I have not turned from your statutes. <sup><strong>158</strong></sup> I look on the faithless with loathing, for they do not obey your word. <sup><strong>159</strong></sup> See how I love your precepts; preserve my life, O LORD, according to your love. <sup><strong>160</strong></sup> All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal. <sup><strong>161</strong></sup> Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word. <sup><strong>162</strong></sup> I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great spoil. <sup><strong>163</strong></sup> I hate and abhor falsehood but I love your law. <sup><strong>164</strong></sup> Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws. <sup><strong>165</strong></sup> Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble. <sup><strong>166</strong></sup> I wait for your salvation, O LORD, and I follow your commands. <sup><strong>167</strong></sup> I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly. <sup><strong>168</strong></sup> I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you. <sup><strong>169</strong></sup> May my cry come before you, O LORD; give me understanding according to your word. <sup><strong>170</strong></sup> May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise. <sup><strong>171</strong></sup> May my lips overflow with praise, for you teach me your decrees. <sup><strong>172</strong></sup> May my tongue sing of your word, for all your commands are righteous. <sup><strong>173</strong></sup> May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts. <sup><strong>174</strong></sup> I long for your salvation, O LORD, and your law is my delight. <sup><strong>175</strong></sup> Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me. <sup><strong>176</strong></sup> I have strayed like a lost sheep.

Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> so that no one may boast before him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore, as it is written: \"Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.\" "},{"_id":"616d85a875868033c7104ff5","topicId":"616d85a475868033c7104fe9","verse":"Isaiah 40:1","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p23040001_05-14\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v23040001-1\">40:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I

He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The man said, \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman, 'for she was taken out of man.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

And the fourth river is Euphrates.  <strong>15</strong> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.  <strong>16</strong> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:  <strong>17</strong> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  <strong>19</strong> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.  <strong>20</strong> And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.  <strong>21</strong> And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;  <strong>22</strong> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.  <strong>23</strong> And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.  <strong>25</strong> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.  <strong>1</strong> Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  <strong>2</strong> And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:  <strong>3</strong> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  <strong>4</strong> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  <strong>5</strong> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  <strong>6</strong> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.  <strong>7</strong> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.  <strong>8</strong> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art  thou?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.  <strong>11</strong> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?

And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  <strong>15</strong> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  <strong>16</strong> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  <strong>17</strong> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;  <strong>18</strong> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;  <strong>19</strong> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  <strong>20</strong> And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.  <strong>21</strong> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  <strong>22</strong> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  <strong>23</strong> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  <strong>24</strong> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
