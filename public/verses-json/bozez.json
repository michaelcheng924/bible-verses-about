The people who were with him were about six hundred men, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Within the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014005_05-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armor, “Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that the LORD will work for us, for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And his armor-bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Do as you wish. Behold, I am with you heart and soul.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines. And the Philistines said, “Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.” And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, “Come up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>And that first strike, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, killed about twenty men within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even the raiders trembled, the earth quaked, and it became a very great panic.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014015_05-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude was dispersing here and there. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count and see who has gone from us.” And when they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Now while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle. And behold, every Philistine’s sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>So the LORD saved Israel that day. And the battle passed beyond Beth-aven.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p09014023_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>And the men of Israel had been hard pressed that day, so Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies.” So none of the people had tasted food. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Now when all the people came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath, so he put out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes became bright. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food this day.’” And the people were faint. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have become bright because I tasted a little of this honey. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies that they found. For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been great.”</p>\n<p id=\"p09014030_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very faint. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>The people pounced on the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slaughtered them on the ground. And the people ate them with the blood. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>Then they told Saul, “Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating with the blood.” And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and say to them, ‘Let every man bring his ox or his sheep and slaughter them here and eat, and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.’” So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night and they slaughtered them there. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014035_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into the hand of Israel?” But he did not answer him that day. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, “Come here, all you leaders of the people, and know and see how this sin has arisen today. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>Then he said to all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>Therefore Saul said, “O LORD God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim. But if this guilt is in your people Israel, give Thummim.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014042_08-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014043-1\">43&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” And Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I will die.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014044-1\">44&nbsp;</b>And Saul said, “God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014045-1\">45&nbsp;</b>Then the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people ransomed Jonathan, so that he did not die. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014046-1\">46&nbsp;</b>Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p09014046_12-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014047-1\">47&nbsp;</b>When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned he routed them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014048-1\">48&nbsp;</b>And he did valiantly and struck the Amalekites and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014048_12-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014049-1\">49&nbsp;</b>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014050-1\">50&nbsp;</b>And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014051-1\">51&nbsp;</b>Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.</p>\n<p id=\"p09014051_12-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09014052-1\">52&nbsp;</b>There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.  <strong>2</strong> And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were  about six hundred men;  <strong>3</strong> And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, I-chabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.  <strong>4</strong> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.  <strong>5</strong> The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.  <strong>6</strong> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.  <strong>7</strong> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.  <strong>8</strong> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.  <strong>9</strong> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.  <strong>10</strong> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us.  <strong>11</strong> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.  <strong>12</strong> And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.  <strong>13</strong> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.  <strong>14</strong> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which  a yoke of oxen might plow.  <strong>15</strong> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.  <strong>16</strong> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.  <strong>17</strong> Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.  <strong>18</strong> And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.  <strong>19</strong> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.  <strong>20</strong> And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.  <strong>21</strong> Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country  round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.  <strong>22</strong> Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.  <strong>23</strong> So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.  <strong>24</strong> And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.  <strong>25</strong> And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.  <strong>27</strong> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.  <strong>28</strong> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.  <strong>29</strong> Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.  <strong>30</strong> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?  <strong>31</strong> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.  <strong>32</strong> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.  <strong>33</strong> Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.  <strong>34</strong> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.  <strong>35</strong> And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.  <strong>36</strong> And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.  <strong>37</strong> And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.  <strong>38</strong> And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.  <strong>39</strong> For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.  <strong>40</strong> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.  <strong>41</strong> Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.  <strong>42</strong> And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.  <strong>43</strong> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.  <strong>44</strong> And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.  <strong>45</strong> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.  <strong>46</strong> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.  <strong>47</strong> So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.  <strong>48</strong> And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.  <strong>49</strong> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:  <strong>50</strong> And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.  <strong>51</strong> And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.  <strong>52</strong> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, \"Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side.\" But he did not tell his father. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez, and the other Seneh. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One cliff stood to the north toward Micmash, the other to the south toward Geba. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, \"Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Do all that you have in mind,\" his armor-bearer said. \"Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Jonathan said, \"Come, then; we will cross over toward the men and let them see us. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has given them into our hands.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. \"Look!\" said the Philistines. \"The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, \"Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson.\" So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, \"Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then panic struck the whole army-those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties-and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Saul said to the men who were with him, \"Muster the forces and see who has left us.\" When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Saul said to Ahijah, \"Bring the ark of God.\" (At that time it was with the Israelites.) <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, \"Withdraw your hand.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So the LORD rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, \"Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!\" So none of the troops tasted food. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then one of the soldiers told him, \"Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be any man who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jonathan said, \"My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then someone said to Saul, \"Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it.You have broken faith,\" he said. \"Roll a large stone over here at once.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then he said, \"Go out among the men and tell them, 'Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'\" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Saul said, \"Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive.Do whatever seems best to you,\" they replied. But the priest said, \"Let us inquire of God here.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> So Saul asked God, \"Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?\" But God did not answer him that day. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Saul therefore said, \"Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die.\" But not one of the men said a word. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Saul then said to all the Israelites, \"You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here.Do what seems best to you,\" the men replied. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, \"Give me the right answer.\" And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Saul said, \"Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.\" And Jonathan was taken. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then Saul said to Jonathan, \"Tell me what you have done.\" So Jonathan told him, \"I merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Saul said, \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But the men said to Saul, \"Should Jonathan die-he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel?

Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul's army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.

On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who now make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.'\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> That same day the man of God gave a sign: \"This is the sign the LORD has declared: The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, \"Seize him!\" But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the king said to the man of God, \"Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored.\" So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king's hand was restored and became as it was before. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The king said to the man of God, \"Come home with me and have something to eat, and I will give you a gift.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But the man of God answered the king, \"Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For I was commanded by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.'\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Their father asked them, \"Which way did he go?\" And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he said to his sons, \"Saddle the donkey for me.\" And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, \"Are you the man of God who came from Judah?I am,\" he replied. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So the prophet said to him, \"Come home with me and eat.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The man of God said, \"I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I have been told by the word of the LORD: 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.'\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The old prophet answered, \"I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the LORD: 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'\" (But he was lying to him.) <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet who had brought him back. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, \"This is what the LORD says: 'You have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers.'\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was thrown down on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Some people who passed by saw the body thrown down there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, \"It is the man of God who defied the word of the LORD. The LORD has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the LORD had warned him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The prophet said to his sons, \"Saddle the donkey for me,\" and they did so. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then he went out and found the body thrown down on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, \"Oh, my brother!\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> After burying him, he said to his sons, \"When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For the message he declared by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.

So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.  <strong>7</strong> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.  <strong>8</strong> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.  <strong>9</strong> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was  good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was  vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.  <strong>10</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,  <strong>11</strong> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.  <strong>12</strong> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.  <strong>13</strong> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be  thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?  <strong>15</strong> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.  <strong>16</strong> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.  <strong>19</strong> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?  <strong>20</strong> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  <strong>21</strong> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.  <strong>22</strong> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.  <strong>23</strong> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.

To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.

And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <strong>44</strong> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.  <strong>45</strong> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.  <strong>46</strong> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.  <strong>47</strong> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.  <strong>48</strong> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  <strong>49</strong> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.  <strong>50</strong> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.  <strong>51</strong> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.  <strong>52</strong> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.  <strong>53</strong> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.  <strong>54</strong> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.  <strong>55</strong> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.  <strong>56</strong> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.  <strong>57</strong> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  <strong>58</strong> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou  young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, \"Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the Philistine said, \"This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now Jesse said to his son David, \"Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now the Israelites had been saying, \"Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> David asked the men standing near him, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, \"This is what will be done for the man who kills him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, \"Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Now what have I done?\" said David. \"Can't I even speak?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Saul, \"Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" Saul said to David, \"Go, and the LORD be with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. \"I cannot go in these,\" he said to Saul, \"because I am not used to them.\" So he took them off. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Come here,\" he said, \"and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> David said to the Philistine, \"You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is that young man?\" Abner replied, \"As surely as you live, O king, I don't know.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The king said, \"Find out whose son this young man is.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"Whose son are you, young man?\" Saul asked him. David said, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.\" "},{"_id":"615a1c537c790f6c0a4915b0","topicId":"615a1c517c790f6c0a4915a9","verse":"1 Samuel 16:1-23","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p09016001_04-13\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v09016001-1\">16:1&nbsp;</b>The LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel?

So Tibni died and Omri became king. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD and sinned more than all those before him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit, so that they provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their worthless idols. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for the other events of Omri's reign, what he did and the things he achieved, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son succeeded him as king. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two years. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the LORD than any of those before him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than did all the kings of Israel before him. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> In Ahab's time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken by Joshua son of Nun.

And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.  <strong>2</strong> And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were  in Carmel; and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.  <strong>3</strong> Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.  <strong>4</strong> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.  <strong>5</strong> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:  <strong>6</strong> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.  <strong>7</strong> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.  <strong>8</strong> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.  <strong>9</strong> And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.  <strong>10</strong> And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.  <strong>11</strong> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?  <strong>12</strong> So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.  <strong>13</strong> And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.  <strong>14</strong> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.  <strong>15</strong> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:  <strong>16</strong> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.  <strong>17</strong> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.  <strong>18</strong> Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn,  and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.  <strong>19</strong> And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.  <strong>20</strong> And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.  <strong>21</strong> Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow  hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.  <strong>22</strong> So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.  <strong>23</strong> And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,  <strong>24</strong> And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.  <strong>25</strong> Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even  Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.  <strong>26</strong> Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as  thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.  <strong>27</strong> And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.  <strong>28</strong> I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.  <strong>29</strong> Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.  <strong>30</strong> And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;  <strong>31</strong> That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.  <strong>32</strong> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:  <strong>33</strong> And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.  <strong>34</strong> For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.  <strong>35</strong> So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.  <strong>36</strong> And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.  <strong>37</strong> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.  <strong>38</strong> And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.  <strong>39</strong> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be  the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.  <strong>40</strong> And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife.  <strong>41</strong> And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.  <strong>42</strong> And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.  <strong>43</strong> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.  <strong>44</strong> But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Maon. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was surly and mean in his dealings. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So he sent ten young men and said to them, \"Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Say to him: 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours! <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Nabal answered David's servants, \"Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> David said to his men, \"Put on your swords!\" So they put on their swords, and David put on his. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> One of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail: \"David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then she told her servants, \"Go on ahead; I'll follow you.\" But she did not tell her husband Nabal. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> David had just said, \"It's been useless-all my watching over this fellow's property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She fell at his feet and said: \"My lord, let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> May my lord pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name-his name is Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my master sent. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Now since the LORD has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like Nabal. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Please forgive your servant's offense, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the LORD's battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When the LORD has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over Israel, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the LORD has brought my master success, remember your servant.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Abigail, \"Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, \"Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, \"Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head.\" Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, \"David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, \"Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's servants.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David's messengers and became his wife. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.

Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.  <strong>5</strong> And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD’S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.  <strong>7</strong> So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his  way.  <strong>8</strong> David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.  <strong>9</strong> And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?  <strong>10</strong> Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me  kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD’S anointed.  <strong>11</strong> Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.  <strong>12</strong> The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.  <strong>13</strong> As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.  <strong>14</strong> After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.  <strong>15</strong> The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.  <strong>17</strong> And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.  <strong>18</strong> And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.  <strong>19</strong> For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.  <strong>20</strong> And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.  <strong>21</strong> Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father’s house.  <strong>22</strong> And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, \"David is in the Desert of En Gedi.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The men said, \"This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'\" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said to his men, \"The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, \"My lord the king!\" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He said to Saul, \"Why do you listen when men say, 'David is bent on harming you'? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This day you have seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I will not lift my hand against my master, because he is the LORD's anointed.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> As the old saying goes, 'From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When David finished saying this, Saul asked, \"Is that your voice, David my son?\" And he wept aloud. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"You are more righteous than I,\" he said. \"You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.

And David avoided out of his presence twice.  <strong>12</strong> And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.  <strong>14</strong> And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.  <strong>15</strong> Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.  <strong>16</strong> But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.  <strong>17</strong> And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.  <strong>18</strong> And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is  my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?  <strong>19</strong> But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.  <strong>20</strong> And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.  <strong>21</strong> And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.  <strong>22</strong> And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king’s son in law.  <strong>23</strong> And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king’s son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?  <strong>24</strong> And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.  <strong>25</strong> And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.  <strong>26</strong> And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.  <strong>28</strong> And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.  <strong>29</strong> And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually.  <strong>30</strong> Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so successfully that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As they danced, they sang: \"Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. \"They have credited David with tens of thousands,\" he thought, \"but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and he hurled it, saying to himself, \"I'll pin David to the wall.\" But David eluded him twice. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left Saul. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In everything he did he had great success, because the LORD was with him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Saul said to David, \"Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD.\" For Saul said to himself, \"I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"I will give her to him,\" he thought, \"so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\" So Saul said to David, \"Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Saul ordered his attendants: \"Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.'\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They repeated these words to David. But David said, \"Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Saul's servants told him what David had said, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'\" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.

But that day the LORD thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Car. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, \"Thus far has the LORD helped us.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again. Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to her, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Samuel continued as judge over Israel all the days of his life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also judged Israel. And he built an altar there to the LORD.

And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.  <strong>12</strong> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;  <strong>14</strong> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.  <strong>15</strong> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.  <strong>16</strong> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me  now: and if not, I will take it by force.  <strong>17</strong> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.  <strong>19</strong> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it  to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <strong>20</strong> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.  <strong>21</strong> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  <strong>23</strong> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.  <strong>24</strong> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.  <strong>25</strong> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.  <strong>26</strong> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.  <strong>27</strong> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?  <strong>28</strong> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be  my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?  <strong>29</strong> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that  thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.  <strong>31</strong> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.  <strong>32</strong> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.  <strong>33</strong> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.  <strong>34</strong> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.  <strong>35</strong> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.  <strong>36</strong> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Hannah prayed and said: \"My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. \"For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; upon them he has set the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. \"It is not by strength that one prevails; <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> those who oppose the LORD will be shattered.

This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \"Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the man said to him, \"Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want,\" the servant would then answer, \"No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they were treating the LORD's offering with contempt. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Samuel was ministering before the LORD -a boy wearing a linen ephod. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, \"May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD.\" Then they would go home. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So he said to them, \"Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?\" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, \"This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you-they will both die on the same day. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, \"Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.\"'\" "},{"_id":"615a1c577c790f6c0a4915bf","topicId":"615a1c517c790f6c0a4915a9","verse":"1 Samuel 1:1-28","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p09001001_05-43\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v09001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09001002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>He had two wives.

She said to her husband, \"After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Do what seems best to you,\" Elkanah her husband told her. \"Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word.\" So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and she said to him, \"As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So now I give him to the LORD.

And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,  <strong>4</strong> Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.  <strong>5</strong> And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me.

So Israel departed unto their tents.  <strong>17</strong> But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.  <strong>18</strong> Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.  <strong>19</strong> So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.  <strong>20</strong> And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.  <strong>21</strong> And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.  <strong>22</strong> But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,  <strong>23</strong> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,  <strong>24</strong> Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.

So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.  <strong>33</strong> So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him: <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Rehoboam answered, \"Go away for three days and then come back to me.\" So the people went away. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. \"How would you advise me to answer these people?\" he asked. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They replied, \"If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He asked them, \"What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The young men who had grown up with him replied, \"Tell these people who have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'-tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, \"Come back to me in three days.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The king answered the people harshly.

My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: \"What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!\" So the Israelites went home. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin-a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men-to make war against the house of Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God: <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> 'This is what the LORD says: Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'\" So they obeyed the word of the LORD and went home again, as the LORD had ordered. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jeroboam thought to himself, \"The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, \"It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And this thing became a sin; the people went even as far as Dan to worship the one there. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings. "}]}
