These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.  <strong>5</strong> And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.  <strong>6</strong> And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,  <strong>7</strong> Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.  <strong>8</strong> And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.  <strong>9</strong> And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand,  <strong>10</strong> The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:  <strong>11</strong> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.  <strong>12</strong> Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.  <strong>13</strong> And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.  <strong>14</strong> And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one  sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.  <strong>15</strong> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.  <strong>16</strong> And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.  <strong>17</strong> And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.  <strong>18</strong> And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.  <strong>19</strong> And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.  <strong>20</strong> And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.  <strong>1</strong> And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.  <strong>2</strong> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.  <strong>3</strong> And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.  <strong>4</strong> Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou  only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.  <strong>5</strong> And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:  <strong>6</strong> And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.  <strong>7</strong> And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.  <strong>8</strong> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.  <strong>1</strong> And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.  <strong>2</strong> And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.  <strong>3</strong> And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.  <strong>4</strong> And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.  <strong>5</strong> And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.  <strong>6</strong> For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.  <strong>7</strong> And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.  <strong>8</strong> And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.  <strong>9</strong> And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory.  <strong>10</strong> And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,  <strong>11</strong> And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.  <strong>12</strong> And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.  <strong>13</strong> And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.  <strong>14</strong> For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which  go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.  <strong>15</strong> Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.  <strong>16</strong> And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.  <strong>17</strong> And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.  <strong>18</strong> And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.  <strong>19</strong> And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.  <strong>20</strong> And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.  <strong>21</strong> And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone  about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.  <strong>1</strong> And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:  <strong>2</strong> With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.  <strong>3</strong> So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.  <strong>4</strong> And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:  <strong>5</strong> And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.  <strong>6</strong> And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.  <strong>7</strong> And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.  <strong>8</strong> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.  <strong>9</strong> And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.  <strong>10</strong> And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and  the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.  <strong>11</strong> And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.  <strong>12</strong> And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.  <strong>13</strong> These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.  <strong>14</strong> These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.  <strong>15</strong> And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.  <strong>16</strong> And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.  <strong>17</strong> For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.  <strong>18</strong> And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.  <strong>1</strong> And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.  <strong>2</strong> And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.  <strong>3</strong> For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.  <strong>4</strong> And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.  <strong>5</strong> For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.  <strong>6</strong> Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  <strong>7</strong> How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.  <strong>8</strong> Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is  the Lord God who judgeth her.  <strong>9</strong> And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,  <strong>10</strong> Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.  <strong>11</strong> And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:  <strong>12</strong> The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,  <strong>13</strong> And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.  <strong>14</strong> And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.  <strong>15</strong> The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,  <strong>16</strong> And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!  <strong>17</strong> For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  <strong>18</strong> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!  <strong>19</strong> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.  <strong>20</strong> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.  <strong>21</strong> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <strong>22</strong> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <strong>23</strong> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  <strong>24</strong> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth--to every nation, tribe, language and people. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He said in a loud voice, \"Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> A second angel followed and said, \"Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: \"If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This calls for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God's commandments and remain faithful to Jesus. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then I heard a voice from heaven say, \"Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.Yes,\" says the Spirit, \"they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one \"like a son of man\" with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, \"Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, \"Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe.\" ","modified":"2022-10-01T13:32:15.748Z"},{"_id":"6168bc4a3b32607a097c11c0","topicId":"6168bc473b32607a097c11b7","verse":"Hebrews 10:4","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p58010001_06-20\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v58010001-1\">10:1&nbsp;</b>For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>\n<p id=\"p58010004_06-20\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said,</p>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p58010005_06-20\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,</span><br><span id=\"p58010005_06-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a body have you prepared for me;</span><br><span id=\"p58010006_06-20\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v58010006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;in burnt offerings and sin offerings</span><br><span id=\"p58010006_06-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have taken no pleasure.</span><br><span id=\"p58010007_06-20\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v58010007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,</span><br><span id=\"p58010007_06-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</p><p id=\"p58010007_06-20\" class=\"same-paragraph\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law), <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>then he added, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>\n<p id=\"p58010010_06-20\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</p>\n<p id=\"p58010014_06-20\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v58010015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us;

And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.  <strong>13</strong> And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.  <strong>14</strong> The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly.  <strong>15</strong> And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.  <strong>16</strong> And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,  <strong>17</strong> Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.  <strong>18</strong> And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.  <strong>19</strong> And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.  <strong>1</strong> And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:  <strong>2</strong> And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.  <strong>3</strong> And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.  <strong>4</strong> And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.  <strong>5</strong> And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.  <strong>6</strong> And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and  threescore days.  <strong>7</strong> And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,  <strong>8</strong> And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.  <strong>9</strong> And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.  <strong>10</strong> And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.  <strong>11</strong> And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.  <strong>13</strong> And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.  <strong>14</strong> And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.  <strong>15</strong> And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.  <strong>16</strong> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.  <strong>17</strong> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.  <strong>1</strong> And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.  <strong>2</strong> And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.  <strong>3</strong> And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.  <strong>4</strong> And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?  <strong>5</strong> And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and  two months.  <strong>6</strong> And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.  <strong>7</strong> And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.  <strong>8</strong> And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.  <strong>9</strong> If any man have an ear, let him hear.  <strong>10</strong> He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.  <strong>11</strong> And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.  <strong>12</strong> And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.  <strong>13</strong> And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,  <strong>14</strong> And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of  those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.  <strong>15</strong> And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.  <strong>16</strong> And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:  <strong>17</strong> And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.  <strong>18</strong> Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.

And again, The Lord shall judge his people.  <strong>31</strong> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  <strong>32</strong> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  <strong>33</strong> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  <strong>34</strong> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.  <strong>35</strong> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  <strong>36</strong> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  <strong>37</strong> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  <strong>38</strong> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  <strong>39</strong> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: \"Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll--I have come to do your will, O God.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> First he said, \"Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them\" (although the law required them to be made). <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then he said, \"Here I am, I have come to do your will.\" He sets aside the first to establish the second. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then he adds: \"Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and since we have a great priest over the house of God, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For we know him who said, \"It is mine to avenge; I will repay,\" and again, \"The Lord will judge his people.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> For in just a very little while, \"He who is coming will come and will not delay. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.

 <strong>15</strong> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were  under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.  <strong>16</strong> For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  <strong>17</strong> For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.  <strong>18</strong> Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.  <strong>19</strong> For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,  <strong>20</strong> Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.  <strong>21</strong> Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.  <strong>22</strong> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  <strong>23</strong> It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  <strong>24</strong> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:  <strong>25</strong> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;  <strong>26</strong> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  <strong>27</strong> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:  <strong>28</strong> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.  <strong>1</strong> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  <strong>2</strong> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.  <strong>3</strong> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.  <strong>4</strong> For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.  <strong>5</strong> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:  <strong>6</strong> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  <strong>7</strong> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.  <strong>8</strong> Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;  <strong>9</strong> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.  <strong>10</strong> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  <strong>11</strong> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  <strong>12</strong> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;  <strong>13</strong> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  <strong>14</strong> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  <strong>15</strong> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,  <strong>16</strong> This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  <strong>17</strong> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  <strong>18</strong> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
