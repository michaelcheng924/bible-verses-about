 <strong>26</strong> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  <strong>27</strong> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  <strong>28</strong> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  <strong>29</strong> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land:  which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  <strong>30</strong> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  <strong>31</strong> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  <strong>32</strong> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae;

And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

And they marvelled at him.  <strong>18</strong> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  <strong>19</strong> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  <strong>20</strong> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  <strong>21</strong> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.  <strong>22</strong> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  <strong>23</strong> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  <strong>24</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  <strong>25</strong> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.  <strong>26</strong> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am  the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  <strong>27</strong> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. <strong>28</strong> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:  <strong>30</strong> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  <strong>31</strong> And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.  <strong>32</strong> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  <strong>33</strong> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  <strong>34</strong> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?  <strong>36</strong> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  <strong>37</strong> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,  <strong>39</strong> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:  <strong>40</strong> Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. <strong>41</strong> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.  <strong>42</strong> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.  <strong>43</strong> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:  <strong>44</strong> For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

Last of all, the woman died too. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, \"How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\" The large crowd listened to him with delight. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> As he taught, Jesus said, \"Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \"I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on.\" "}]}
