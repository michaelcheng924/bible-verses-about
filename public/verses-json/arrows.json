They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.  <strong>10</strong> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.  <strong>11</strong> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.  <strong>12</strong> Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.  <strong>13</strong> Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.  <strong>14</strong> But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  <strong>15</strong> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.  <strong>16</strong> Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.  <strong>17</strong> Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.  <strong>18</strong> Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.  <strong>19</strong> For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.  <strong>20</strong> The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.  <strong>21</strong> Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?  <strong>22</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their  shoulders.  <strong>23</strong> And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.  <strong>24</strong> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?  <strong>25</strong> But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.  <strong>26</strong> And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Listen to me, you islands; hear this, you distant nations: Before I was born the LORD called me; from my birth he has made mention of my name. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He said to me, \"You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But I said, \"I have labored to no purpose; I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing. Yet what is due me is in the LORD's hand, and my reward is with my God.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And now the LORD says- he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has been my strength- <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> he says: \"It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says- the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel- to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers: \"Kings will see you and rise up, princes will see and bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"In the time of my favor I will answer you, and in the day of salvation I will help you; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> to say to the captives, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Be free!'\"They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> See, they will come from afar- some from the north, some from the west, some from the region of Aswan. \" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Shout for joy, O heavens; rejoice, O earth; burst into song, O mountains! For the LORD comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Zion said, \"The LORD has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before me. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Your sons hasten back, and those who laid you waste depart from you. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Lift up your eyes and look around; all your sons gather and come to you. As surely as I live,\" declares the LORD, \"you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Though you were ruined and made desolate and your land laid waste, now you will be too small for your people, and those who devoured you will be far away. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The children born during your bereavement will yet say in your hearing, 'This place is too small for us; give us more space to live in.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then you will say in your heart, 'Who bore me these? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these-where have they come from?'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"See, I will beckon to the Gentiles, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who hope in me will not be disappointed.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Can plunder be taken from warriors, or captives rescued from the fierce? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But this is what the LORD says: \"Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine.

And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  <strong>38</strong> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.  <strong>39</strong> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.  <strong>40</strong> But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> And Saul was there, giving approval to his death. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So there was great joy in that city. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, \"This man is the divine power known as the Great Power.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and said, \"Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter answered: \"May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Simon answered, \"Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \"Go south to the road--the desert road--that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The Spirit told Philip, \"Go to that chariot and stay near it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: \"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \"Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.

Why go ye about to kill me?  <strong>20</strong> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?  <strong>21</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.  <strong>22</strong> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.  <strong>23</strong> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?  <strong>24</strong> Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.  <strong>25</strong> Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?  <strong>26</strong> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?  <strong>27</strong> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.  <strong>28</strong> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.  <strong>29</strong> But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.  <strong>30</strong> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.  <strong>31</strong> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?  <strong>32</strong> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.  <strong>33</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.  <strong>34</strong> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.  <strong>35</strong> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?  <strong>36</strong> What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither  ye cannot come?  <strong>37</strong> In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.  <strong>38</strong> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  <strong>39</strong> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)  <strong>40</strong> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.  <strong>41</strong> Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?  <strong>42</strong> Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?  <strong>43</strong> So there was a division among the people because of him.  <strong>44</strong> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.  <strong>45</strong> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?  <strong>46</strong> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.  <strong>47</strong> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?  <strong>48</strong> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?  <strong>49</strong> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.  <strong>50</strong> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)  <strong>51</strong> Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?  <strong>52</strong> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.  <strong>53</strong> And every man went unto his own house.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jesus' brothers said to him, \"You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For even his own brothers did not believe in him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Therefore Jesus told them, \"The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Having said this, he stayed in Galilee. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, \"Where is that man?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, \"He is a good man.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Others replied, \"No, he deceives the people.\" But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The Jews were amazed and asked, \"How did this man get such learning without having studied?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You are demon-possessed,\" the crowd answered. \"Who is trying to kill you?\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I did one miracle, and you are all astonished. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, \"Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, \"Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, \"When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Jews said to one another, \"Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and 'Where I am, you cannot come'?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, \"If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> On hearing his words, some of the people said, \"Surely this man is the Prophet.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Others said, \"He is the Christ.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Still others asked, \"How can the Christ come from Galilee? Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, \"Why didn't you bring him in?\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"No one ever spoke the way this man does,\" the guards declared. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"You mean he has deceived you also?\" the Pharisees retorted. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> They replied, \"Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then each went to his own home.

am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.  <strong>9</strong> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.  <strong>10</strong> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.  <strong>11</strong> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  <strong>12</strong> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.  <strong>13</strong> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <strong>14</strong> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.  <strong>15</strong> But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.  <strong>16</strong> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;  <strong>18</strong> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.  <strong>19</strong> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.  <strong>20</strong> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.  <strong>21</strong> For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.  <strong>22</strong> And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.  <strong>23</strong> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.  <strong>24</strong> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.  <strong>25</strong> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.  <strong>26</strong> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?  <strong>27</strong> And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.  <strong>28</strong> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.  <strong>29</strong> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?  <strong>30</strong> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.  <strong>31</strong> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.  <strong>32</strong> And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.  <strong>33</strong> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.  <strong>34</strong> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:  <strong>35</strong> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it  out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him  by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.  <strong>36</strong> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.  <strong>37</strong> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.  <strong>39</strong> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.  <strong>40</strong> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.  <strong>41</strong> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.  <strong>42</strong> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.  <strong>43</strong> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <strong>44</strong> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.  <strong>45</strong> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.  <strong>46</strong> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.  <strong>47</strong> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.  <strong>48</strong> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  <strong>49</strong> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.  <strong>50</strong> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.  <strong>51</strong> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.  <strong>52</strong> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.  <strong>53</strong> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.  <strong>54</strong> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.  <strong>55</strong> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.  <strong>56</strong> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.  <strong>57</strong> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  <strong>58</strong> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou  young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, \"Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the Philistine said, \"This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now Jesse said to his son David, \"Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now the Israelites had been saying, \"Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> David asked the men standing near him, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, \"This is what will be done for the man who kills him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, \"Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Now what have I done?\" said David. \"Can't I even speak?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Saul, \"Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" Saul said to David, \"Go, and the LORD be with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. \"I cannot go in these,\" he said to Saul, \"because I am not used to them.\" So he took them off. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Come here,\" he said, \"and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> David said to the Philistine, \"You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is that young man?\" Abner replied, \"As surely as you live, O king, I don't know.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The king said, \"Find out whose son this young man is.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"Whose son are you, young man?\" Saul asked him. David said, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.\" "},{"_id":"6158f9662ee2ce61bea42c1d","topicId":"6158f95f2ee2ce61bea42c04","verse":"Deuteronomy 23:1-25","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p05023001_06-27\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v05023001-1\">23:1&nbsp;</b>“No one whose testicles are crushed or whose male organ is cut off shall enter the assembly of the LORD.</p>\n<p id=\"p05023001_06-27\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05023002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>“No one born of a forbidden union may enter the assembly of the LORD.
