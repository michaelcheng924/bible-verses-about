sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.  <strong>2</strong> Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.  <strong>3</strong> Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.  <strong>4</strong> Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is  everlasting strength:  <strong>5</strong> For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.  <strong>6</strong> The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.  <strong>7</strong> The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.  <strong>8</strong> Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.  <strong>9</strong> With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.  <strong>10</strong> Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.  <strong>11</strong> LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.  <strong>12</strong> LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.  <strong>13</strong> O LORD our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.  <strong>14</strong> They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.  <strong>15</strong> Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.  <strong>16</strong> LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.  <strong>17</strong> Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.  <strong>18</strong> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.  <strong>19</strong> Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.  <strong>20</strong> Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.  <strong>21</strong> For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; God makes salvation its walls and ramparts. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that keeps faith. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD, the LORD, is the Rock eternal. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Feet trample it down- the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The path of the righteous is level; O upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yes, LORD, walking in the way of your laws, we wait for you; your name and renown are the desire of our hearts. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> My soul yearns for you in the night; in the morning my spirit longs for you. When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Though grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and regard not the majesty of the LORD. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> O LORD, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> LORD, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> O LORD, our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They are now dead, they live no more; those departed spirits do not rise. You punished them and brought them to ruin; you wiped out all memory of them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You have enlarged the nation, O LORD; you have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> LORD, they came to you in their distress; when you disciplined them, they could barely whisper a prayer. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As a woman with child and about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, O LORD. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> We were with child, we writhed in pain, but we gave birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth; we have not given birth to people of the world. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But your dead will live; their bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust, wake up and shout for joy. Your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See, the LORD is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will disclose the blood shed upon her; she will conceal her slain no longer. ","modified":"2022-08-11T16:09:49.281Z"}]}
