incline thine ear unto my sayings.  <strong>21</strong> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.  <strong>22</strong> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.  <strong>23</strong> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.  <strong>24</strong> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.  <strong>25</strong> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.  <strong>26</strong> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.  <strong>27</strong> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.  <strong>1</strong> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:  <strong>2</strong> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.  <strong>3</strong> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:  <strong>4</strong> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.  <strong>5</strong> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.  <strong>6</strong> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.  <strong>7</strong> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.  <strong>8</strong> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:  <strong>9</strong> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:  <strong>10</strong> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be  in the house of a stranger;  <strong>11</strong> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,  <strong>12</strong> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;  <strong>13</strong> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!  <strong>14</strong> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.  <strong>15</strong> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.  <strong>16</strong> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.  <strong>17</strong> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.  <strong>18</strong> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.  <strong>19</strong> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.  <strong>20</strong> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?  <strong>21</strong> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.  <strong>22</strong> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.  <strong>23</strong> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.  <strong>1</strong> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,  <strong>2</strong> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.  <strong>3</strong> Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.  <strong>4</strong> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.  <strong>5</strong> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.  <strong>6</strong> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:  <strong>7</strong> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  <strong>8</strong> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.  <strong>9</strong> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?  <strong>10</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>11</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.  <strong>12</strong> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.  <strong>13</strong> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;  <strong>14</strong> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.  <strong>16</strong> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are  an abomination unto him:  <strong>17</strong> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,  <strong>18</strong> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,  <strong>19</strong> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.  <strong>20</strong> My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:  <strong>21</strong> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.  <strong>22</strong> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.  <strong>23</strong> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:  <strong>24</strong> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  <strong>25</strong> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.  <strong>26</strong> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.  <strong>27</strong> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?  <strong>28</strong> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  <strong>29</strong> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.  <strong>30</strong> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;  <strong>31</strong> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.  <strong>32</strong> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.  <strong>33</strong> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.  <strong>34</strong> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  <strong>35</strong> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.  <strong>1</strong> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.  <strong>2</strong> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.  <strong>3</strong> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.  <strong>4</strong> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:  <strong>5</strong> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.  <strong>6</strong> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,  <strong>7</strong> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,  <strong>8</strong> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,  <strong>9</strong> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:  <strong>10</strong> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.  <strong>11</strong> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:  <strong>12</strong> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)  <strong>13</strong> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,  <strong>14</strong> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  <strong>16</strong> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,  with fine linen of Egypt.  <strong>17</strong> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  <strong>18</strong> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.  <strong>19</strong> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:  <strong>20</strong> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.  <strong>21</strong> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.  <strong>22</strong> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;  <strong>23</strong> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.  <strong>24</strong> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.  <strong>25</strong> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.  <strong>26</strong> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men  have been slain by her.  <strong>27</strong> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.  <strong>1</strong> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  <strong>2</strong> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  <strong>3</strong> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  <strong>4</strong> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.  <strong>5</strong> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  <strong>6</strong> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.  <strong>7</strong> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  <strong>8</strong> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is  nothing froward or perverse in them.  <strong>9</strong> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  <strong>10</strong> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  <strong>11</strong> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  <strong>12</strong> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  <strong>13</strong> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  <strong>14</strong> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.  <strong>15</strong> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  <strong>16</strong> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.  <strong>17</strong> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.  <strong>18</strong> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  <strong>19</strong> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.  <strong>20</strong> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:  <strong>21</strong> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  <strong>22</strong> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  <strong>23</strong> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  <strong>24</strong> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.  <strong>25</strong> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:  <strong>26</strong> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  <strong>27</strong> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  <strong>28</strong> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:  <strong>29</strong> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:  <strong>30</strong> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:  and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;  <strong>31</strong> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.  <strong>32</strong> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.  <strong>33</strong> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.  <strong>34</strong> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.  <strong>35</strong> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.  <strong>36</strong> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.  <strong>1</strong> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:  <strong>2</strong> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.  <strong>3</strong> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,  <strong>4</strong> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  <strong>5</strong> Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.  <strong>6</strong> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.  <strong>7</strong> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.  <strong>8</strong> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.  <strong>9</strong> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.  <strong>10</strong> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.  <strong>11</strong> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.  <strong>12</strong> If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. <strong>13</strong> A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.  <strong>14</strong> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,  <strong>15</strong> To call passengers who go right on their ways:  <strong>16</strong> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  <strong>17</strong> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.  <strong>18</strong> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that  her guests are in the depths of hell.  <strong>1</strong> The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.  <strong>2</strong> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.  <strong>3</strong> The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.  <strong>4</strong> He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.  <strong>5</strong> He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.  <strong>6</strong> Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.  <strong>7</strong> The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.  <strong>8</strong> The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.  <strong>9</strong> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.  <strong>10</strong> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.  <strong>11</strong> The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.  <strong>12</strong> Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.  <strong>13</strong> In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.  <strong>14</strong> Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.  <strong>15</strong> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.  <strong>16</strong> The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.  <strong>17</strong> He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.  <strong>18</strong> He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.  <strong>19</strong> In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.  <strong>20</strong> The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.  <strong>21</strong> The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.  <strong>22</strong> The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.  <strong>23</strong> It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.  <strong>24</strong> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.  <strong>25</strong> As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more:  but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.  <strong>26</strong> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is  the sluggard to them that send him.  <strong>27</strong> The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.  <strong>28</strong> The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.  <strong>29</strong> The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.  <strong>30</strong> The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.  <strong>31</strong> The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.  <strong>32</strong> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.  <strong>1</strong> A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.  <strong>2</strong> When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.  <strong>3</strong> The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.  <strong>4</strong> Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.  <strong>5</strong> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.  <strong>6</strong> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.  <strong>7</strong> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.  <strong>8</strong> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.  <strong>9</strong> An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.  <strong>10</strong> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.  <strong>11</strong> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.  <strong>12</strong> He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.  <strong>13</strong> A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.  <strong>14</strong> Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.  <strong>15</strong> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.  <strong>16</strong> A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.  <strong>17</strong> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is  cruel troubleth his own flesh.  <strong>18</strong> The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.  <strong>19</strong> As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.  <strong>20</strong> They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.  <strong>21</strong> Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.  <strong>22</strong> As a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.  <strong>23</strong> The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.  <strong>24</strong> There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is  that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.  <strong>25</strong> The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.  <strong>26</strong> He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.  <strong>27</strong> He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.  <strong>28</strong> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.  <strong>29</strong> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.  <strong>30</strong> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.  <strong>31</strong> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.  <strong>1</strong> Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.  <strong>2</strong> A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.  <strong>3</strong> A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.  <strong>4</strong> A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.  <strong>5</strong> The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.  <strong>6</strong> The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.  <strong>7</strong> The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.  <strong>8</strong> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.  <strong>9</strong> He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.  <strong>10</strong> A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.  <strong>11</strong> He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.  <strong>12</strong> The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.  <strong>13</strong> The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.  <strong>14</strong> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.  <strong>15</strong> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.  <strong>16</strong> A fool’s wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.  <strong>17</strong> He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.  <strong>18</strong> There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.  <strong>19</strong> The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.  <strong>20</strong> Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.  <strong>21</strong> There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.  <strong>22</strong> Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.  <strong>23</strong> A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.  <strong>24</strong> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.  <strong>25</strong> Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.  <strong>26</strong> The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.  <strong>27</strong> The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.  <strong>28</strong> In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.  <strong>1</strong> A wise son heareth his father’s instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.  <strong>2</strong> A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.  <strong>3</strong> He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.  <strong>4</strong> The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.  <strong>5</strong> A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.  <strong>6</strong> Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.  <strong>7</strong> There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.  <strong>8</strong> The ransom of a man’s life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.  <strong>9</strong> The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.  <strong>10</strong> Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is  wisdom.  <strong>11</strong> Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.  <strong>12</strong> Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.  <strong>13</strong> Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.  <strong>14</strong> The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.  <strong>15</strong> Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.  <strong>16</strong> Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.  <strong>17</strong> A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.  <strong>18</strong> Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.  <strong>19</strong> The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.  <strong>20</strong> He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.  <strong>21</strong> Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repaid.  <strong>22</strong> A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.  <strong>23</strong> Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.  <strong>24</strong> He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.  <strong>25</strong> The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.  <strong>1</strong> Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.  <strong>2</strong> He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is  perverse in his ways despiseth him.  <strong>3</strong> In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.  <strong>4</strong> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.  <strong>5</strong> A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.  <strong>6</strong> A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.  <strong>7</strong> Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.  <strong>8</strong> The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.  <strong>9</strong> Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is  favour.  <strong>10</strong> The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.  <strong>11</strong> The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.  <strong>12</strong> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.  <strong>13</strong> Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.  <strong>14</strong> The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.  <strong>15</strong> The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.  <strong>16</strong> A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.  <strong>17</strong> He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.  <strong>18</strong> The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.  <strong>19</strong> The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  <strong>20</strong> The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath  many friends.  <strong>21</strong> He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.  <strong>22</strong> Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be  to them that devise good.  <strong>23</strong> In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth  only to penury.  <strong>24</strong> The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.  <strong>25</strong> A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness  speaketh lies.  <strong>26</strong> In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.  <strong>27</strong> The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.  <strong>28</strong> In the multitude of people is the king’s honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.  <strong>29</strong> He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.  <strong>30</strong> A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.  <strong>31</strong> He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.  <strong>32</strong> The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.  <strong>33</strong> Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.  <strong>34</strong> Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.  <strong>35</strong> The king’s favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.  <strong>1</strong> A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.  <strong>2</strong> The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.  <strong>3</strong> The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.  <strong>4</strong> A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.  <strong>5</strong> A fool despiseth his father’s instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.  <strong>6</strong> In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.  <strong>7</strong> The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.  <strong>8</strong> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.  <strong>9</strong> The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.  <strong>10</strong> Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.  <strong>11</strong> Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?  <strong>12</strong> A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.  <strong>13</strong> A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.  <strong>14</strong> The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.  <strong>15</strong> All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.  <strong>16</strong> Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.  <strong>17</strong> Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.  <strong>18</strong> A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.  <strong>19</strong> The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.  <strong>20</strong> A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.  <strong>21</strong> Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.  <strong>22</strong> Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.  <strong>23</strong> A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken  in due season, how good is it!  <strong>24</strong> The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.  <strong>25</strong> The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.  <strong>26</strong> The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.  <strong>27</strong> He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.  <strong>28</strong> The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.  <strong>29</strong> The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.  <strong>30</strong> The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.  <strong>31</strong> The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.  <strong>32</strong> He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.  <strong>33</strong> The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.  <strong>1</strong> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.  <strong>3</strong> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.  <strong>4</strong> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.  <strong>5</strong> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.  <strong>6</strong> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.  <strong>7</strong> When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.  <strong>8</strong> Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.  <strong>9</strong> A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.  <strong>10</strong> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.  <strong>11</strong> A just weight and balance are the LORD’S: all the weights of the bag are his work.  <strong>12</strong> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.  <strong>13</strong> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.  <strong>14</strong> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.  <strong>15</strong> In the light of the king’s countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.  <strong>16</strong> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!  <strong>17</strong> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.  <strong>18</strong> Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.  <strong>19</strong> Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.  <strong>20</strong> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.  <strong>21</strong> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.  <strong>22</strong> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.  <strong>23</strong> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.  <strong>24</strong> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.  <strong>25</strong> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.  <strong>26</strong> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.  <strong>27</strong> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is  as a burning fire.  <strong>28</strong> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.  <strong>29</strong> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.  <strong>30</strong> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.  <strong>31</strong> The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.  <strong>33</strong> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.  <strong>2</strong> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.  <strong>3</strong> The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.  <strong>4</strong> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.  <strong>5</strong> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.  <strong>6</strong> Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.  <strong>7</strong> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.  <strong>8</strong> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.  <strong>9</strong> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.  <strong>10</strong> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.  <strong>11</strong> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.  <strong>12</strong> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.  <strong>13</strong> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.  <strong>14</strong> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.  <strong>15</strong> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?  <strong>17</strong> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.  <strong>18</strong> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.  <strong>19</strong> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.  <strong>20</strong> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.  <strong>21</strong> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.  <strong>22</strong> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.  <strong>23</strong> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.  <strong>24</strong> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.  <strong>25</strong> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.  <strong>26</strong> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.  <strong>27</strong> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.  <strong>28</strong> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and  he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.  <strong>1</strong> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and  intermeddleth with all wisdom.  <strong>2</strong> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.  <strong>3</strong> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.  <strong>4</strong> The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and  the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.  <strong>5</strong> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.  <strong>6</strong> A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.  <strong>7</strong> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are  the snare of his soul.  <strong>8</strong> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.  <strong>9</strong> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.  <strong>10</strong> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.  <strong>11</strong> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.  <strong>12</strong> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.  <strong>13</strong> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.  <strong>14</strong> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?  <strong>15</strong> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.  <strong>16</strong> A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  <strong>17</strong> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  <strong>18</strong> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.  <strong>19</strong> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.  <strong>20</strong> A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  <strong>21</strong> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.  <strong>22</strong> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  <strong>24</strong> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.  <strong>1</strong> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.  <strong>2</strong> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is  not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.  <strong>3</strong> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.  <strong>4</strong> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.  <strong>5</strong> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.  <strong>6</strong> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is  a friend to him that giveth gifts.  <strong>7</strong> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.  <strong>8</strong> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.  <strong>9</strong> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.  <strong>10</strong> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.  <strong>11</strong> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.  <strong>12</strong> The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.  <strong>13</strong> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.  <strong>14</strong> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the LORD.  <strong>15</strong> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.  <strong>16</strong> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but  he that despiseth his ways shall die.  <strong>17</strong> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.  <strong>18</strong> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.  <strong>19</strong> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.  <strong>20</strong> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.  <strong>21</strong> There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.  <strong>22</strong> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.  <strong>23</strong> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.  <strong>24</strong> A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.  <strong>25</strong> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.  <strong>26</strong> He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.  <strong>27</strong> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.  <strong>28</strong> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.  <strong>29</strong> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.

Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: \"Out of Egypt I called my son.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and said, \"Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: \"He will be called a Nazarene.\" "},{"_id":"616adf8e9dfb4d9c011d9052","topicId":"616adf8c9dfb4d9c011d904d","verse":"Acts 4:1-37","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p44004001_07-5\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v44004001-1\">4:1&nbsp;</b>And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.</p>\n<p id=\"p44004004_07-5\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, “By what power or by what name did you do this?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead—by him this man is standing before you well. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”</p>\n<p id=\"p44004012_07-5\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44004013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished.

And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement), <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.

my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?  <strong>3</strong> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.  <strong>4</strong> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:  <strong>5</strong> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  <strong>6</strong> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.  <strong>7</strong> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  <strong>8</strong> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.  <strong>9</strong> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.  <strong>10</strong> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.  <strong>11</strong> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.  <strong>12</strong> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.  <strong>13</strong> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.  <strong>14</strong> She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.  <strong>15</strong> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.  <strong>16</strong> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.  <strong>17</strong> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.  <strong>18</strong> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.  <strong>19</strong> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.  <strong>20</strong> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.  <strong>21</strong> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.  <strong>22</strong> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is  silk and purple.  <strong>23</strong> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.  <strong>24</strong> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  <strong>25</strong> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.  <strong>26</strong> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.  <strong>27</strong> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.  <strong>28</strong> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,  and he praiseth her.  <strong>29</strong> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.  <strong>30</strong> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but  a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.  <strong>31</strong> Give her of

She is worth far more than rubies. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
