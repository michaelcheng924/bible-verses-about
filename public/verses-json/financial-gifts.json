Then there will be equality, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> as it is written: \"He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
