When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He said, \"If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way-now that you have come to your servant.Very well,\" they answered, \"do as you say.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. \"Quick,\" he said, \"get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Where is your wife Sarah?\" they asked him. \"There, in the tent,\" he said. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.\" Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, \"After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Abraham, \"Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, \"I did not laugh.\" But he said, \"Yes, you did laugh.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Abraham approached him and said: \"Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Far be it from you to do such a thing-to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The LORD said, \"If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then Abraham spoke up again: \"Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?If I find forty-five there,\" he said, \"I will not destroy it.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Once again he spoke to him, \"What if only forty are found there?\" He said, \"For the sake of forty, I will not do it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then he said, \"May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?\" He answered, \"I will not do it if I find thirty there.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Abraham said, \"Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?\" He said, \"For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then he said, \"May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?\" He answered, \"For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.

So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  <strong>17</strong> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.  <strong>19</strong> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;  <strong>20</strong> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of  the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of  that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.  <strong>21</strong> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <strong>22</strong> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.  <strong>23</strong> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <strong>24</strong> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  <strong>25</strong> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.  <strong>26</strong> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  <strong>27</strong> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.  <strong>28</strong> Hitherto is the end of the matter.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\" "},{"_id":"6168b7c53b32607a097c0f2e","topicId":"6168b7be3b32607a097c0f16","verse":"Isaiah 43:6","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p23043006_01-26\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23043006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say to the north, Give up,</span><br><span id=\"p23043006_01-26\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the south, Do not withhold;</span><br><span id=\"p23043006_01-26\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;bring my sons from afar</span><br><span id=\"p23043006_01-26\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my daughters from the end of the earth,</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>6</strong> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;  ","niv":"<sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.'
