<strong>28</strong> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.  <strong>29</strong> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.  <strong>30</strong> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.  <strong>31</strong> The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.  <strong>33</strong> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> To man belong the plans of the heart, but from the LORD comes the reply of the tongue. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the LORD. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and your plans will succeed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The LORD works out everything for his own ends- even the wicked for a day of disaster. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD detests all the proud of heart. Be sure of this: They will not go unpunished. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for; through the fear of the LORD a man avoids evil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When a man's ways are pleasing to the LORD, he makes even his enemies live at peace with him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The lips of a king speak as an oracle, and his mouth should not betray justice. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Honest scales and balances are from the LORD; all the weights in the bag are of his making. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Kings detest wrongdoing, for a throne is established through righteousness. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Kings take pleasure in honest lips; they value a man who speaks the truth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> A king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will appease it. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When a king's face brightens, it means life; his favor is like a rain cloud in spring. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How much better to get wisdom than gold, to choose understanding rather than silver! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The highway of the upright avoids evil; he who guards his way guards his life. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers, and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The wise in heart are called discerning, and pleasant words promote instruction. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Understanding is a fountain of life to those who have it, but folly brings punishment to fools. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> A wise man's heart guides his mouth, and his lips promote instruction. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> There is a way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The laborer's appetite works for him; his hunger drives him on. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> A scoundrel plots evil, and his speech is like a scorching fire. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A perverse man stirs up dissension, and a gossip separates close friends. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> A violent man entices his neighbor and leads him down a path that is not good. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He who winks with his eye is plotting perversity; he who purses his lips is bent on evil. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained by a righteous life. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD.
