Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.  <strong>8</strong> Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:  <strong>9</strong> But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.  <strong>10</strong> And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.  <strong>11</strong> And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto  magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:  <strong>12</strong> For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say. <strong>13</strong> And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.  <strong>14</strong> And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?  <strong>15</strong> And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.  <strong>16</strong> And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:  <strong>17</strong> And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?  <strong>18</strong> And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.  <strong>19</strong> And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.  <strong>20</strong> But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?  <strong>21</strong> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. <strong>22</strong> And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.  <strong>23</strong> The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.  <strong>24</strong> Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?  <strong>25</strong> And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?  <strong>26</strong> If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?  <strong>27</strong> Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <strong>28</strong> If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?  <strong>29</strong> And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.  <strong>30</strong> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. <strong>31</strong>           But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>32</strong> Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.  <strong>33</strong> Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.  <strong>34</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>35</strong> Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;  <strong>36</strong> And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.  <strong>37</strong> Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.  <strong>38</strong> And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.  <strong>39</strong> And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.  <strong>40</strong> Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. <strong>41</strong> Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?  <strong>42</strong> And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?  <strong>43</strong> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  <strong>44</strong> Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.  <strong>45</strong> But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;  <strong>46</strong> The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.  <strong>47</strong> And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.  <strong>48</strong> But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. <strong>49</strong>           I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?  <strong>50</strong> But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!  <strong>51</strong> Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:  <strong>52</strong> For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.  <strong>53</strong> The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. <strong>54</strong>           And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.  <strong>55</strong> And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.  <strong>56</strong> Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?  <strong>57</strong> Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?  <strong>58</strong>           When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.  <strong>59</strong> I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: \"Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell.

Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he told them this parable: \"The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\"' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Consider how the lilies grow.

Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Peter asked, \"Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The Lord answered, \"Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.
