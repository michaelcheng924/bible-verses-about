For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard.
