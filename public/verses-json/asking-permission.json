But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
