He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.  <strong>8</strong> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  <strong>9</strong> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but  he said, I am he.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  <strong>11</strong> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash:  and I went and washed, and I received sight.  <strong>12</strong> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.  <strong>13</strong> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.  <strong>14</strong> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  <strong>15</strong> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.  <strong>17</strong> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.  <strong>18</strong> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.  <strong>19</strong> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?  <strong>20</strong> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:  <strong>21</strong> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.  <strong>22</strong> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.  <strong>24</strong> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.  <strong>25</strong> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.  <strong>26</strong> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?  <strong>27</strong> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?  <strong>28</strong> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.  <strong>29</strong> We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow,  we know not from whence he is.  <strong>30</strong> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.  <strong>31</strong> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.  <strong>32</strong> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.  <strong>33</strong> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.  <strong>34</strong> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  <strong>35</strong> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  <strong>36</strong> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  <strong>37</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.  <strong>39</strong> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.  <strong>40</strong> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  <strong>41</strong> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.

It was your eyes he opened.\" The man replied, \"He is a prophet.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Is this your son?\" they asked. \"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"We know he is our son,\" the parents answered, \"and we know he was born blind. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> That was why his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \"Give glory to God, \"they said. \"We know this man is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He replied, \"Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He answered, \"I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they hurled insults at him and said, \"You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The man answered, \"Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> To this they replied, \"You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!\" And they threw him out. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked. \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the man said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What? Are we blind too?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.

No one was strong enough to subdue him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?

The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying.

And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher any more?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But they laughed at him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, \"Talitha koum!\" (which means, \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\" ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  <strong>3</strong> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  <strong>4</strong> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  <strong>5</strong> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  <strong>6</strong> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  <strong>7</strong> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were  under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  <strong>8</strong> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  <strong>9</strong> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  <strong>10</strong> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>11</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>12</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>13</strong> And the evening and the morning were the third day.  <strong>14</strong> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  <strong>15</strong> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>16</strong> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  <strong>17</strong> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  <strong>18</strong> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>19</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  <strong>20</strong> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  <strong>21</strong> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>22</strong> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  <strong>23</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  <strong>24</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  <strong>25</strong> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>26</strong> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  <strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  <strong>28</strong> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  <strong>30</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  <strong>31</strong> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was  very good.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God called the expanse \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.
