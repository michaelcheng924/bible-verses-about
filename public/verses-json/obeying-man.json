Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"No,\" said Peter, \"you shall never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered, \"Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then, Lord,\" Simon Peter replied, \"not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. \"Do you understand what I have done for you?\" he asked them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture: 'He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am He. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, \"I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, \"Ask him which one he means.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, \"Lord, who is it?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\" Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"What you are about to do, do quickly,\" Jesus told him, but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When he was gone, Jesus said, \"Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Simon Peter asked him, \"Lord, where are you going?\" Jesus replied, \"Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Peter asked, \"Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Jesus answered, \"Will you really lay down your life for me? I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!

Then they brought these men before the king.  <strong>14</strong> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?  <strong>15</strong> Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?  <strong>16</strong> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.  <strong>17</strong> If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.  <strong>18</strong> But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.  <strong>19</strong> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.  <strong>20</strong> And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them  into the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>21</strong> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.  <strong>23</strong> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>24</strong> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.  <strong>25</strong> He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.  <strong>26</strong> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the fire.  <strong>27</strong> And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.  <strong>28</strong> Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be  the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.  <strong>29</strong> Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.  <strong>30</strong> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He then summoned the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then the herald loudly proclaimed, \"This is what you are commanded to do, O peoples, nations and men of every language: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> As soon as you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Therefore, as soon as they heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> At this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the Jews. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, \"O king, live forever! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You have issued a decree, O king, that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But there are some Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon-Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego-who pay no attention to you, O king. They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, \"Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, \"Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?\" They replied, \"Certainly, O king.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said, \"Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!\" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \"Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
