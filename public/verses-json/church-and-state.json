And he said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.  <strong>19</strong> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?  <strong>20</strong> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.  <strong>21</strong> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.  <strong>22</strong> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.  <strong>23</strong> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.  <strong>24</strong> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.  <strong>25</strong> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.  <strong>26</strong> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.  <strong>27</strong> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.  <strong>28</strong> And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is  better than thou.  <strong>29</strong> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.  <strong>30</strong> Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.  <strong>31</strong> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.  <strong>32</strong> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.  <strong>33</strong> And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.  <strong>34</strong> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.  <strong>35</strong> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Samuel said, \"What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Saul answered, \"The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Stop!\" Samuel said to Saul. \"Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.Tell me,\" Saul replied. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Samuel said, \"Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"But I did obey the LORD,\" Saul said. \"I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But Samuel replied: \"Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Saul said to Samuel, \"I have sinned. I violated the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Samuel said to him, \"I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Samuel said to him, \"The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors-to one better than you. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then Samuel said, \"Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.\" Agag came to him confidently, thinking, \"Surely the bitterness of death is past.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But Samuel said, \"As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women.\" And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the LORD was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.
