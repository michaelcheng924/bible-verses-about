He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The commandments, \"Do not commit adultery,Do not murder,Do not steal,Do not covet,\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.

if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  <strong>22</strong> Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. <strong>23</strong>           Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.  <strong>24</strong> And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  <strong>25</strong> But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.  <strong>26</strong> The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>27</strong> Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.  <strong>28</strong> But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  <strong>29</strong> And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>30</strong> And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.  <strong>31</strong> So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.  <strong>32</strong> Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:  <strong>33</strong> Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  <strong>34</strong> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  <strong>35</strong> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;  <strong>2</strong> And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.  <strong>3</strong> The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?  <strong>4</strong> And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  <strong>5</strong> And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?  <strong>6</strong> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.  <strong>7</strong> They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?  <strong>8</strong> He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.  <strong>9</strong> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  <strong>10</strong> His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.  <strong>11</strong> But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.  <strong>12</strong> For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their  mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. <strong>13</strong> Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.  <strong>14</strong> But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come! <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones.

Should I receive comfort in these?  <strong>7</strong> Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.  <strong>8</strong> Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.  <strong>9</strong> And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.  <strong>10</strong> Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou wast not grieved.  <strong>11</strong> And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?  <strong>12</strong> I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.  <strong>13</strong> When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain;  <strong>14</strong> And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.  <strong>15</strong> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.  <strong>16</strong> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.  <strong>17</strong> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.  <strong>18</strong> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.  <strong>19</strong> I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is  far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.  <strong>20</strong> But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.  <strong>21</strong> There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"But you-come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes! <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; they, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In the light of these things, should I relent? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked on their nakedness. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You went to Molech with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away; you descended to the grave itself! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You were wearied by all your ways, but you would not say, 'It is hopeless.' You found renewal of your strength, and so you did not faint. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have been false to me, and have neither remembered me nor pondered this in your hearts? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But the man who makes me his refuge will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And it will be said: \"Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this is what the high and lofty One says- he who lives forever, whose name is holy: \"I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will not accuse forever, nor will I always be angry, for then the spirit of man would grow faint before me- the breath of man that I have created. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I was enraged by his sinful greed; I punished him, and hid my face in anger, yet he kept on in his willful ways. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> creating praise on the lips of the mourners in Israel. Peace, peace, to those far and near,\" says the LORD. \"And I will heal them.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"There is no peace,\" says my God, \"for the wicked.\" "},{"_id":"61625a12b1c7c31277405cd5","topicId":"616259fbb1c7c31277405cbc","verse":"Isaiah 49:15","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p23049015_01-26\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23049015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can a woman forget her nursing child,</span><br><span id=\"p23049015_01-26\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?</span><br><span id=\"p23049015_01-26\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Even these may forget,</span><br><span id=\"p23049015_01-26\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet I will not forget you.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>15</strong> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.
