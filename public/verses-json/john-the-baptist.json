Repent and believe the good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> At once they left their nets and followed him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Be quiet!\" said Jesus sternly. \"Come out of him!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \"What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The whole town gathered at the door, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Simon and his companions went to look for him, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and when they found him, they exclaimed: \"Everyone is looking for you!\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
