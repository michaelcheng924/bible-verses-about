The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you.' <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So also, the one with the two talents gained two more. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the man who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"The man with the two talents also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"'Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?' <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.' <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?' <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\" "},{"_id":"6158ff4a5788f063699d8575","topicId":"6158ff425788f063699d855d","verse":"Matthew 6:9-13","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40006009_01-25\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40006009-1\">9&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Pray then like this:</span></p>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p40006009_01-25\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"woc\">“Our Father in heaven,</span><br><span id=\"p40006009_01-25\" class=\"line\"><span class=\"woc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;hallowed be your name.</span></span><br><span id=\"p40006010_01-25\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline woc\" id=\"v40006010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"woc\">Your kingdom come,</span><br><span id=\"p40006010_01-25\" class=\"line\"><span class=\"woc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;your will be done,</span><br><span id=\"p40006010_01-25\" class=\"indent line\"><span class=\"woc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on earth as it is in heaven.</span></span><br><span id=\"p40006011_01-25\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline woc\" id=\"v40006011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"woc\">Give us this day our daily bread,</span></span><br><span id=\"p40006012_01-25\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline woc\" id=\"v40006012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"woc\">and forgive us our debts,</span><br><span id=\"p40006012_01-25\" class=\"indent line\"><span class=\"woc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as we also have forgiven our debtors.</span></span><br><span id=\"p40006013_01-25\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline woc\" id=\"v40006013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"woc\">And lead us not into temptation,</span><br><span id=\"p40006013_01-25\" class=\"indent line\"><span class=\"woc\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but deliver us from evil.</span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>9</strong> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  <strong>10</strong> Thy kingdom come.
