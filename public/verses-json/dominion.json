When I act, who can reverse it?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says- your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: \"For your sake I will send to Babylon and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians, in the ships in which they took pride. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I am the LORD, your Holy One, Israel's Creator, your King.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says- he who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> who drew out the chariots and horses, the army and reinforcements together, and they lay there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, O Israel. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices.
