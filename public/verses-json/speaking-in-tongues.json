The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014005_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014012_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014019_04-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>In the Law it is written, “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p46014025_06-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014033_06-1\">As in all the churches of the saints, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014035_06-1\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>But all things should be done decently and in order.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.  <strong>2</strong> For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.  <strong>3</strong> But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.  <strong>4</strong> He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.  <strong>5</strong> I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.  <strong>6</strong> Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?  <strong>7</strong> And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?  <strong>8</strong> For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?  <strong>9</strong> So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.  <strong>10</strong> There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.  <strong>12</strong> Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts,  seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.  <strong>13</strong> Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.  <strong>14</strong> For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.  <strong>15</strong> What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.  <strong>16</strong> Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  <strong>17</strong> For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  <strong>18</strong> I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  <strong>19</strong> Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.  <strong>20</strong> Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.  <strong>21</strong> In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.  <strong>22</strong> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.  <strong>23</strong> If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  <strong>24</strong> But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:  <strong>25</strong> And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.  <strong>26</strong> How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.  <strong>27</strong> If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be  by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.  <strong>28</strong> But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.  <strong>29</strong> Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.  <strong>30</strong> If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.  <strong>31</strong> For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.  <strong>32</strong> And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  <strong>33</strong> For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.  <strong>34</strong> Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.  <strong>35</strong> And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.  <strong>36</strong> What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?  <strong>37</strong> If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.  <strong>38</strong> But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.  <strong>39</strong> Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.  <strong>40</strong> Let all things be done decently and in order.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In the Law it is written: \"Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me,\" says the Lord. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, \"God is really among you!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.

 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?

So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, \"In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> One day the evil spirit answered them, \"Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. \"After I have been there,\" he said, \"I must visit Rome also.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: \"Men, you know we receive a good income from this business. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: \"Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
