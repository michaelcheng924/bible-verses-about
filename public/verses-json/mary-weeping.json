If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  <strong>10</strong> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.  <strong>11</strong> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  <strong>12</strong> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  <strong>13</strong> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.  <strong>14</strong> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  <strong>15</strong> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  <strong>16</strong> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.  <strong>17</strong> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.  <strong>18</strong> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:  <strong>19</strong> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  <strong>20</strong> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <strong>22</strong> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  <strong>24</strong> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  <strong>25</strong> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:  <strong>26</strong> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?  <strong>27</strong> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.  <strong>28</strong> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.  <strong>29</strong> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.  <strong>30</strong> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.  <strong>31</strong> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.  <strong>32</strong> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  <strong>33</strong> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,  <strong>34</strong> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.  <strong>35</strong> Jesus wept.  <strong>36</strong> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!  <strong>37</strong> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?  <strong>38</strong> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.  <strong>39</strong> Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.  <strong>40</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  <strong>41</strong> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.  <strong>42</strong> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.  <strong>43</strong> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  <strong>44</strong> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  <strong>45</strong> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.  <strong>46</strong> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.  <strong>47</strong> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.  <strong>48</strong> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.  <strong>49</strong> And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,  <strong>50</strong> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.  <strong>51</strong> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;  <strong>52</strong> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.  <strong>53</strong> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.  <strong>54</strong> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.  <strong>55</strong> And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.  <strong>56</strong> Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?  <strong>57</strong> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So the sisters sent word to Jesus, \"Lord, the one you love is sick.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When he heard this, Jesus said, \"This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then he said to his disciples, \"Let us go back to Judea.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"But Rabbi,\" they said, \"a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> After he had said this, he went on to tell them, \"Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> His disciples replied, \"Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So then he told them plainly, \"Lazarus is dead, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, \"Let us also go, that we may die with him.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Lord,\" Martha said to Jesus, \"if you had been here, my brother would not have died. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise again.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Martha answered, \"I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she told him, \"I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. \"The Teacher is here,\" she said, \"and is asking for you.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Where have you laid him?\" he asked. \"Come and see, Lord,\" they replied. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus wept. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then the Jews said, \"See how he loved him!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But some of them said, \"Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Take away the stone,\" he said. \"But, Lord,\" said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \"by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \"Father, I thank you that you have heard me. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \"Take off the grave clothes and let him go.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"What are we accomplishing?\" they asked. \"Here is this man performing many miraculous signs. If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, \"You know nothing at all! <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> So from that day on they plotted to take his life. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, \"What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.

Pick up your mat and walk.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \"It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But he replied, \"The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus gave them this answer: \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> yet you refuse to come to me to have life. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"I do not accept praise from men, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God? <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?\" "},{"_id":"616797fca3a86b670bc2fbbe","topicId":"616797f5a3a86b670bc2fba8","verse":"Mark 16:1","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p41016001_03-24\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v41016001-1\">16:1&nbsp;</b>When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother  of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.
