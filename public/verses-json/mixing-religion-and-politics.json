It is  not good to have respect of persons in judgment.  <strong>24</strong> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:  <strong>25</strong> But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.  <strong>26</strong> Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.  <strong>27</strong> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.  <strong>28</strong> Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.  <strong>29</strong> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.  <strong>30</strong> I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;  <strong>31</strong> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.  <strong>32</strong> Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.  <strong>33</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>34</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Do not envy wicked men, do not desire their company; <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> for waging war you need guidance, and for victory many advisers. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the assembly at the gate he has nothing to say. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He who plots evil will be known as a schemer. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The schemes of folly are sin, and men detest a mocker. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> If you falter in times of trouble, how small is your strength! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> If you say, \"But we knew nothing about this,\" does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Know also that wisdom is sweet to your soul; if you find it, there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against a righteous man's house, do not raid his dwelling place; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again, but the wicked are brought down by calamity. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when he stumbles, do not let your heart rejoice, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Fear the LORD and the king, my son, and do not join with the rebellious, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> for those two will send sudden destruction upon them, and who knows what calamities they can bring? Further Sayings of the Wise <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good: <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Whoever says to the guilty, \"You are innocent\"- peoples will curse him and nations denounce him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not say, \"I'll do to him as he has done to me; I'll pay that man back for what he did.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> I went past the field of the sluggard, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw: <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.

Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.  <strong>7</strong> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.  <strong>8</strong> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  <strong>9</strong> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.  <strong>11</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?  <strong>12</strong> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  <strong>13</strong> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:  <strong>14</strong> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.  <strong>15</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.  <strong>16</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.  <strong>17</strong> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:  <strong>18</strong> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.  <strong>19</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.  <strong>20</strong> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  <strong>21</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.  <strong>22</strong> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.  <strong>23</strong> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.  <strong>24</strong> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.  <strong>25</strong> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.  <strong>26</strong> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <strong>27</strong> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?  <strong>28</strong> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,  <strong>29</strong> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?  <strong>30</strong> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.  <strong>31</strong> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.  <strong>32</strong> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.  <strong>35</strong> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.  <strong>36</strong> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.  <strong>37</strong> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.  <strong>38</strong> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. <strong>39</strong> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.  <strong>40</strong> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.  <strong>41</strong> And many more believed because of his own word;  <strong>42</strong> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.  <strong>43</strong> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.  <strong>44</strong> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.  <strong>45</strong> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.  <strong>46</strong> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.  <strong>47</strong> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.  <strong>48</strong> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.  <strong>49</strong> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  <strong>51</strong> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,  saying, Thy son liveth.  <strong>52</strong> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  <strong>53</strong> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  <strong>54</strong> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Now he had to go through Samaria. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \"Will you give me a drink?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ) <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I have no husband,\" she replied. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus declared, \"Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They came out of the town and made their way toward him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Meanwhile his disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat something.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And because of his words many more became believers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the two days he left for Galilee. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" The man took Jesus at his word and departed. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and all his household believed. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.

David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,  <strong>2</strong> The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.  <strong>3</strong> The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.  <strong>4</strong> And he shall be as the light of the morning, when  the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as  the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.  <strong>5</strong> Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.  <strong>6</strong> But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:  <strong>7</strong> But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.  <strong>8</strong> These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.  <strong>9</strong> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:  <strong>10</strong> He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.  <strong>11</strong> And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.  <strong>12</strong> But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.  <strong>13</strong> And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.  <strong>14</strong> And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.  <strong>15</strong> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!  <strong>16</strong> And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.  <strong>18</strong> And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.  <strong>19</strong> Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.  <strong>20</strong> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:  <strong>21</strong> And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.  <strong>22</strong> These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.  <strong>23</strong> He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.  <strong>24</strong> Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,  <strong>25</strong> Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,  <strong>26</strong> Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,  <strong>27</strong> Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,  <strong>28</strong> Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,  <strong>29</strong> Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,  <strong>30</strong> Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,  <strong>31</strong> Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,  <strong>32</strong> Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,  <strong>33</strong> Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,  <strong>34</strong> Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,  <strong>35</strong> Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,  <strong>36</strong> Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,  <strong>37</strong> Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah,  <strong>38</strong> Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,  <strong>39</strong> Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

And from each man, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and with every living creature that was with you-the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you-every living creature on earth. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And God said, \"This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come: <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So God said to Noah, \"This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father's nakedness. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> he said, \"Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He also said, \"Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> May God extend the territory of Japheth; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> After the flood Noah lived 350 years. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Altogether, Noah lived 950 years, and then he died.
