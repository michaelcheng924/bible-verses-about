And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.  <strong>5</strong> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?  <strong>6</strong> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their  lips, but their heart is far from me.  <strong>7</strong> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  <strong>8</strong> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.  <strong>10</strong> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:  <strong>11</strong> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is  Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.  <strong>12</strong> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;  <strong>13</strong> Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. <strong>14</strong> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:  <strong>15</strong> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.  <strong>16</strong> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>17</strong> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.  <strong>18</strong> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;  <strong>19</strong> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?  <strong>20</strong> And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.  <strong>21</strong> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  <strong>22</strong> Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:  <strong>23</strong> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.  <strong>24</strong> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it:  but he could not be hid.  <strong>25</strong> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:  <strong>26</strong> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.  <strong>27</strong> But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.  <strong>28</strong> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.  <strong>29</strong> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.  <strong>30</strong> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.  <strong>31</strong> And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.  <strong>32</strong> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  <strong>34</strong> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,  that is, Be opened.  <strong>35</strong> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.  <strong>36</strong> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;  <strong>37</strong> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were \"unclean,\" that is, unwashed. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. ) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \"'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\") <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ). <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> People were overwhelmed with amazement. \"He has done everything well,\" they said. \"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\" "},{"_id":"615ba5047d79181a31670f2f","topicId":"615ba4fd7d79181a31670f1a","verse":"Matthew 24:24-35","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40024024_01-23\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40024024-1\">24&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40024025-1\">25&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">See, I have told you beforehand.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40024026-1\">26&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out.

Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  <strong>17</strong> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  <strong>18</strong> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  <strong>19</strong> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. <strong>21</strong>           Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>22</strong> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  <strong>23</strong> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <strong>24</strong>           Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:  <strong>25</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  <strong>26</strong> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:  <strong>27</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.  <strong>28</strong> And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:  <strong>29</strong> For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
