You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You who brag about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> As it is written: \"God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.
