And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.  <strong>3</strong> And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.  <strong>4</strong> And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.  <strong>5</strong> And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.  <strong>6</strong> Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.  <strong>7</strong> Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.  <strong>8</strong> And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.  <strong>9</strong> The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.  <strong>10</strong> And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.  <strong>11</strong> And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?  <strong>12</strong> Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;  <strong>13</strong> Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.  <strong>14</strong> And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.  <strong>15</strong> And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.  <strong>16</strong> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:  <strong>17</strong> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.  <strong>18</strong> When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her.  <strong>19</strong> So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  <strong>20</strong> And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.  <strong>21</strong> I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?  <strong>22</strong> So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \"Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.\" Then she kissed them and they wept aloud <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and said to her, \"We will go back with you to your people.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But Naomi said, \"Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me-even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Look,\" said Naomi, \"your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Ruth replied, \"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, \"Can this be Naomi?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Don't call me Naomi, \"she told them. \"Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.

No one was strong enough to subdue him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?

The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying.

And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher any more?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing?

I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For I am the LORD, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Do not be afraid, O worm Jacob, O little Israel, for I myself will help you,\" declares the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"See, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up, and a gale will blow them away. But you will rejoice in the LORD and glory in the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"The poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the LORD will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I will make rivers flow on barren heights, and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into springs. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. I will set pines in the wasteland, the fir and the cypress together, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> so that people may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Present your case,\" says the LORD. \"Set forth your arguments,\" says Jacob's King. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Bring in your idols to tell us what is going to happen. Tell us what the former things were, so that we may consider them and know their final outcome. Or declare to us the things to come, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> tell us what the future holds, so we may know that you are gods. Do something, whether good or bad, so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless; he who chooses you is detestable. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes- one from the rising sun who calls on my name. He treads on rulers as if they were mortar, as if he were a potter treading the clay. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know, or beforehand, so we could say, 'He was right'? No one told of this, no one foretold it, no one heard any words from you. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I was the first to tell Zion, 'Look, here they are!' I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I look but there is no one- no one among them to give counsel, no one to give answer when I ask them. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> See, they are all false! Their deeds amount to nothing; their images are but wind and confusion.
