In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> perseverance, character; and character, hope. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
