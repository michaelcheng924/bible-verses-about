 <strong>2</strong> (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)  <strong>3</strong> By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,  <strong>4</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;  <strong>5</strong> Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;  <strong>6</strong> Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.  <strong>7</strong> And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.  <strong>8</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.  <strong>9</strong> For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.  <strong>11</strong> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.  <strong>12</strong> Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.  <strong>13</strong> And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.  <strong>14</strong> And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.  <strong>15</strong> Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;  <strong>16</strong> Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;  <strong>17</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.  <strong>18</strong> And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them:  <strong>19</strong> Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.  <strong>20</strong> Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:  <strong>21</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes;  <strong>22</strong> And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;  <strong>23</strong> Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.  <strong>24</strong>           Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,  <strong>25</strong> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,  <strong>26</strong> The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is  mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.  <strong>27</strong> Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?  <strong>28</strong> For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them;  and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  <strong>29</strong> And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.  <strong>30</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>31</strong> Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:  <strong>32</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> (This was after King Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.) <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said: <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For I know the plans I have for you,\" declares the LORD, \"plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will be found by you,\" declares the LORD, \"and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,\" declares the LORD, \"and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You may say, \"The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David's throne and all the people who remain in this city, your countrymen who did not go with you into exile- <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> yes, this is what the LORD Almighty says: \"I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like poor figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth and an object of cursing and horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For they have not listened to my words,\" declares the LORD, \"words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: \"I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: 'The LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives and in my name have spoken lies, which I did not tell them to do. I know it and am a witness to it,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Tell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the other priests. You said to Zephaniah, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> 'The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the LORD; you should put any madman who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He has sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.'\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Zephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Send this message to all the exiles: 'This is what the LORD says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has led you to believe a lie, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants.
