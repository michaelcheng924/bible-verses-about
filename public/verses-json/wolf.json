 <strong>3</strong> Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock.  <strong>4</strong> The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.  <strong>5</strong> And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.  <strong>6</strong> My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them. <strong>7</strong> Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;  <strong>8</strong> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;  <strong>9</strong> Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;  <strong>10</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.  <strong>11</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.  <strong>12</strong> As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.  <strong>13</strong> And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.  <strong>14</strong> I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.  <strong>15</strong> I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>16</strong> I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.  <strong>17</strong> And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.  <strong>18</strong> Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?  <strong>19</strong> And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.  <strong>20</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even  I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle.  <strong>21</strong> Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad;  <strong>22</strong> Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle.  <strong>23</strong> And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.  <strong>24</strong> And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it.  <strong>25</strong> And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.  <strong>26</strong> And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.  <strong>27</strong> And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.  <strong>28</strong> And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.  <strong>29</strong> And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.  <strong>30</strong> Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are  my people, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>31</strong> And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and  I am your God, saith the Lord GOD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who only take care of themselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"'Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> therefore, O shepherds, hear the word of the LORD: <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"'For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I myself will search for my sheep and look after them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink clear water? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says to them: See, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will save my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will judge between one sheep and another. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I will place over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David will be prince among them. I the LORD have spoken. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"'I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the desert and sleep in the forests in safety. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will bless them and the places surrounding my hill. I will send down showers in season; there will be showers of blessing. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The trees of the field will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will know that I am the LORD, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will make them afraid. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then they will know that I, the LORD their God, am with them and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are people, and I am your God, declares the Sovereign LORD.'\" "},{"_id":"616d88b175868033c710517f","topicId":"616d88aa75868033c7105168","verse":"Ezekiel 24:21","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p26024021_01-24\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v26024021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>‘Say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and your sons and your daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>21</strong> Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.
