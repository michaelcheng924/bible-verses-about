The people indicated their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai: <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Reuben was 46,500. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the descendants of Simeon: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were counted and listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Simeon was 59,300. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Gad was 45,650. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Issachar was 54,400. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Manasseh was 32,200. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> From the descendants of Benjamin: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> From the descendants of Dan: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Dan was 62,700. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> From the descendants of Asher: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel's army were counted according to their families. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The total number was 603,550. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The families of the tribe of Levi, however, were not counted along with the others. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The LORD had said to Moses: <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony-over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it.

Anyone else who goes near it shall be put to death. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his own standard. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the Testimony so that wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses. "}]}
