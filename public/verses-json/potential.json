 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.

So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  <strong>15</strong> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  <strong>16</strong> And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.  <strong>17</strong> And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.  <strong>18</strong> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.  <strong>19</strong> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.  <strong>20</strong> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.  <strong>21</strong> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.  <strong>22</strong> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;  <strong>24</strong> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was  empty, there was no water in it.  <strong>25</strong> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.  <strong>26</strong> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?  <strong>27</strong> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.  <strong>28</strong> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.  <strong>29</strong> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was  not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.  <strong>30</strong> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is  not; and I, whither shall I go?  <strong>31</strong> And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;  <strong>32</strong> And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son’s coat or no.  <strong>33</strong> And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.  <strong>34</strong> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.  <strong>35</strong> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.  <strong>36</strong> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented robe for him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Listen to this dream I had: <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> His brothers said to him, \"Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?\" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. \"Listen,\" he said, \"I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, \"What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and Israel said to Joseph, \"As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.Very well,\" he replied. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So he said to him, \"Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.\" Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, \"What are you looking for?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He replied, \"I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"They have moved on from here,\" the man answered. \"I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'\" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Here comes that dreamer!\" they said to each other. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. \"Let's not take his life,\" he said. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him.\" Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe-the richly ornamented robe he was wearing- <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Judah said to his brothers, \"What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.\" His brothers agreed. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He went back to his brothers and said, \"The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, \"We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He recognized it and said, \"It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. \"No,\" he said, \"in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son.\" So his father wept for him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.
