","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The country was brought under their control, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Joshua said to the Israelites: \"How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each.

Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the house of Joseph in its territory on the north. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the LORD our God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to them.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, \"Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph: <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the desert of Beth Aven. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah and on down into the Arabah. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, had the following cities: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Kephar Ammoni, Ophni and Geba-twelve towns and their villages. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath-fourteen towns and their villages.

Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.  <strong>14</strong> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.  <strong>16</strong> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.  <strong>17</strong> And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.  <strong>18</strong> And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:  <strong>19</strong> And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.  <strong>20</strong> And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.  <strong>21</strong> And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.  <strong>23</strong> And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.  <strong>24</strong> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.  <strong>25</strong> And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.  <strong>26</strong> And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.  <strong>28</strong> And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.  <strong>29</strong> Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:  <strong>30</strong> And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.  <strong>31</strong> And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:  <strong>32</strong> And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.  <strong>33</strong> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.  <strong>34</strong> And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:  <strong>35</strong> And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.  <strong>36</strong> And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:  <strong>37</strong> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were  therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.  <strong>38</strong> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:  <strong>39</strong> And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.  <strong>40</strong> So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.  <strong>41</strong> And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.  <strong>42</strong> And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.  <strong>43</strong> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"Come up and help me attack Gibeon,\" he said, \"because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then the five kings of the Amorites-the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon-joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: \"Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel: \"O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel! <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> he said, \"Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But don't stop! Pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completely-almost to a man-but the few who were left reached their fortified cities. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Joshua said, \"Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So they brought the five kings out of the cave-the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, \"Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.\" So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Joshua said to them, \"Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The LORD also gave that city and its king into Israel's hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army-until no survivors were left. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings.

And they said, We are witnesses.  <strong>23</strong> Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>24</strong> And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.  <strong>25</strong> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.  <strong>26</strong> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.  <strong>28</strong> So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.  <strong>30</strong> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.  <strong>31</strong> And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.  <strong>32</strong> And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.  <strong>33</strong> And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the desert for a long time. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"'Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you-also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Now fear the LORD and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your forefathers worshiped beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the people answered, \"Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> It was the LORD our God himself who brought us and our fathers up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, because he is our God.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Joshua said to the people, \"You are not able to serve the LORD. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But the people said to Joshua, \"No! We will serve the LORD.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Joshua said, \"You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD.Yes, we are witnesses,\" they replied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Now then,\" said Joshua, \"throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And the people said to Joshua, \"We will serve the LORD our God and obey him.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he drew up for them decrees and laws. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"See!\" he said to all the people. \"This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the LORD had done for Israel. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And Joseph's bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph's descendants. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
