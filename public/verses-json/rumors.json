Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.  <strong>20</strong> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.  <strong>21</strong> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>22</strong> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.  <strong>23</strong> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.  <strong>24</strong> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.  <strong>25</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.  <strong>26</strong> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.  <strong>27</strong> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.  <strong>28</strong> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.  <strong>29</strong> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.  <strong>30</strong> As he spake these words, many believed on him.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;  <strong>32</strong> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  <strong>33</strong> They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.  <strong>35</strong> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but  the Son abideth ever.  <strong>36</strong> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.  <strong>37</strong> I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.  <strong>38</strong> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.  <strong>39</strong> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.  <strong>40</strong> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.  <strong>41</strong> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.  <strong>42</strong> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.  <strong>43</strong> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.  <strong>44</strong> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your  father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

Selah.  <strong>14</strong> Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.  <strong>15</strong> But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.  <strong>16</strong> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;  <strong>17</strong> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.  <strong>18</strong> Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.  <strong>19</strong> He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.  <strong>20</strong> Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> both low and high, rich and poor alike: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me- <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him- <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough- <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> that he should live on forever and not see decay. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For all can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Their tombs will remain their houses forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had named lands after themselves. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But man, despite his riches, does not endure; he is like the beasts that perish. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings. Selah <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Like sheep they are destined for the grave, and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But God will redeem my life from the grave; he will surely take me to himself. Selah <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases; <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Though while he lived he counted himself blessed- and men praise you when you prosper- <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light of life. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
