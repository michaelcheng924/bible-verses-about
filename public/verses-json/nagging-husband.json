Forgive as the Lord forgave you. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
