Amen. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

 <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
