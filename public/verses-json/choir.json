And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.  <strong>36</strong> He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.

Abraham his servant.  <strong>43</strong> And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:  <strong>44</strong> And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
