Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.  <strong>6</strong> The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.  <strong>7</strong> And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.  <strong>8</strong> And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.  <strong>9</strong> And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.  <strong>10</strong> And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.  <strong>11</strong> And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.  <strong>12</strong> Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and  I will not keep anger for ever.  <strong>13</strong> Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.  <strong>14</strong> Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:  <strong>15</strong> And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.  <strong>16</strong> And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that  be done any more.  <strong>17</strong> At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.  <strong>18</strong> In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.  <strong>19</strong> But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.  <strong>20</strong> Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.  <strong>22</strong> Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.  <strong>23</strong> Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.  <strong>24</strong> For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.  <strong>25</strong> We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man, should he return to her again? Would not the land be completely defiled?

Is there any place where you have not been ravished? By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers, sat like a nomad in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Therefore the showers have been withheld, and no spring rains have fallen.

Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Because Israel's immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD said to me, \"Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Go, proclaim this message toward the north: \"'Return, faithless Israel,' declares the LORD, 'I will frown on you no longer, for I am merciful,' declares the LORD, 'I will not be angry forever. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Only acknowledge your guilt- you have rebelled against the LORD your God, you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree, and have not obeyed me,'\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Return, faithless people,\" declares the LORD, \"for I am your husband. I will choose you-one from a town and two from a clan-and bring you to Zion. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,\" declares the LORD, \"men will no longer say, 'The ark of the covenant of the LORD.' It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In those days the house of Judah will join the house of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your forefathers as an inheritance. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"I myself said, \"'How gladly would I treat you like sons and give you a desirable land, the most beautiful inheritance of any nation.' I thought you would call me 'Father' and not turn away from following me. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But like a woman unfaithful to her husband, so you have been unfaithful to me, O house of Israel,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> A cry is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the people of Israel, because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the LORD their God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Return, faithless people; I will cure you of backsliding.Yes, we will come to you, for you are the LORD our God. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception; surely in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> From our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our fathers' labor- their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Let us lie down in our shame, and let our disgrace cover us.
