Do not taste! Do not touch!\"? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
