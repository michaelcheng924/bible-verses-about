The LORD will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> On that dayHOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the LORD's house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD Almighty.
