He guides me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
