And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.  <strong>12</strong> Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.  <strong>13</strong> But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.  <strong>14</strong> Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.  <strong>15</strong> And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.  <strong>16</strong> And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.  <strong>17</strong> For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.  <strong>18</strong> Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,  ","niv":"<sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I was standing on the bank of the great river, the Tigris, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen, with a belt of the finest gold around his waist. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> His body was like chrysolite, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; I had no strength left, my face turned deathly pale and I was helpless. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then I heard him speaking, and as I listened to him, I fell into a deep sleep, my face to the ground. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He said, \"Daniel, you who are highly esteemed, consider carefully the words I am about to speak to you, and stand up, for I have now been sent to you.\" And when he said this to me, I stood up trembling. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then he continued, \"Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> While he was saying this to me, I bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing before me, \"I am overcome with anguish because of the vision, my lord, and I am helpless. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> How can I, your servant, talk with you, my lord? My strength is gone and I can hardly breathe.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength. ","modified":"2023-01-22T09:32:39.137Z"}]}
