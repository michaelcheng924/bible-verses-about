He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him.

They said, \"He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and said, \"If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> There was a written notice above him, which read:|sc THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: \"Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But the other criminal rebuked him. \"Don't you fear God,\" he said, \"since you are under the same sentence? <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom. \" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Jesus called out with a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.\" When he had said this, he breathed his last. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, \"Surely this was a righteous man.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes.

And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.  <strong>5</strong> And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.  <strong>6</strong> And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.  <strong>7</strong> And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.  <strong>8</strong> Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;  <strong>10</strong> And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.  <strong>12</strong> And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.  <strong>13</strong> Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?  <strong>14</strong> And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.  <strong>15</strong> Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.  <strong>16</strong> And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?  <strong>18</strong> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.  <strong>19</strong> When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.  <strong>20</strong> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.  <strong>21</strong> The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.  <strong>22</strong> Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.  <strong>23</strong> And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.  <strong>24</strong> When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.  <strong>25</strong> Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.  <strong>26</strong> Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.  <strong>27</strong> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.  <strong>28</strong> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.  <strong>29</strong> And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it  upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!  <strong>30</strong> And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.  <strong>31</strong> And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.  <strong>32</strong> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.  <strong>33</strong> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,  <strong>34</strong> They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.  <strong>35</strong> And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.  <strong>36</strong> And sitting down they watched him there;  <strong>37</strong> And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>38</strong> Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.  <strong>39</strong> And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,  <strong>40</strong> And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it  in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.  <strong>41</strong> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,  <strong>42</strong> He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.  <strong>43</strong> He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.  <strong>44</strong> The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.  <strong>45</strong> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.  <strong>46</strong> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <strong>47</strong> Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.  <strong>48</strong> And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.  <strong>49</strong> The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.  <strong>51</strong> And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;  <strong>52</strong> And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,  <strong>53</strong> And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.  <strong>54</strong> Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.  <strong>55</strong> And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:  <strong>56</strong> Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.  <strong>57</strong> When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:  <strong>58</strong> He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.  <strong>59</strong> And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,  <strong>60</strong> And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.  <strong>61</strong> And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.  <strong>62</strong> Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,  <strong>63</strong> Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.  <strong>64</strong> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.  <strong>65</strong> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it  as sure as ye can.  <strong>66</strong> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"I have sinned,\" he said, \"for I have betrayed innocent blood.What is that to us?\" they replied. \"That's your responsibility.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The chief priests picked up the coins and said, \"It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: \"They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Pilate asked him, \"Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, \"Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: \"Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?\" asked the governor. \"Barabbas,\" they answered. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?\" Pilate asked. They all answered, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. \"I am innocent of this man's blood,\" he said. \"It is your responsibility!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> All the people answered, \"Let his blood be on us and on our children!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" they said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> and saying, \"You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When some of those standing there heard this, they said, \"He's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The rest said, \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, \"Surely he was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.

And they murmured against her.  <strong>6</strong> And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.  <strong>7</strong> For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.  <strong>8</strong> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.  <strong>9</strong> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. <strong>10</strong> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.  <strong>11</strong> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.  <strong>12</strong> And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  <strong>13</strong> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.  <strong>14</strong> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  <strong>15</strong> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and  prepared: there make ready for us.  <strong>16</strong> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.  <strong>17</strong> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.  <strong>18</strong> And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.  <strong>19</strong> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?  <strong>20</strong> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.  <strong>21</strong> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. <strong>22</strong> And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.  <strong>23</strong> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it  to them: and they all drank of it.  <strong>24</strong> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.  <strong>25</strong> Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. <strong>26</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.  <strong>28</strong> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>29</strong> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will  not I.  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>31</strong> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.  <strong>32</strong> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.  <strong>33</strong> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;  <strong>34</strong> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.  <strong>35</strong> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.  <strong>36</strong> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.  <strong>37</strong> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  <strong>38</strong> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>39</strong> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.  <strong>40</strong> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.  <strong>41</strong> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>42</strong> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. <strong>43</strong> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.  <strong>44</strong> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.  <strong>45</strong> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.  <strong>46</strong> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.  <strong>47</strong> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  <strong>48</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?  <strong>49</strong> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.  <strong>50</strong> And they all forsook him, and fled.  <strong>51</strong> And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:  <strong>52</strong> And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.  <strong>53</strong> And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.  <strong>54</strong> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.  <strong>55</strong> And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.  <strong>56</strong> For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.  <strong>57</strong> And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,  <strong>58</strong> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.  <strong>59</strong> But neither so did their witness agree together.  <strong>60</strong> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>61</strong> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?  <strong>62</strong> And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>63</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?  <strong>64</strong> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.  <strong>65</strong> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.  <strong>66</strong> And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:  <strong>67</strong> And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>68</strong> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.  <strong>69</strong> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.  <strong>70</strong> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.  <strong>71</strong> But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.  <strong>72</strong> And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Returning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Then everyone deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> \"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. \"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.

 <strong>3</strong> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,  <strong>4</strong> That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.  <strong>5</strong> There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.  <strong>6</strong> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.  <strong>7</strong> And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,  <strong>9</strong> According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.  <strong>10</strong> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.  <strong>11</strong> And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.  <strong>12</strong> And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.  <strong>13</strong> But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.  <strong>14</strong> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.  <strong>15</strong> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.  <strong>16</strong> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.  <strong>17</strong> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.  <strong>18</strong> And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.  <strong>19</strong> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.  <strong>20</strong> And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.  <strong>21</strong> And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.  <strong>22</strong> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.  <strong>24</strong> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,  <strong>25</strong> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.  <strong>26</strong> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,  <strong>27</strong> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.  <strong>28</strong> And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art  highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art  thou among women.  <strong>29</strong> And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.  <strong>30</strong> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.  <strong>31</strong> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.  <strong>32</strong> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:  <strong>33</strong> And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.  <strong>34</strong> Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?  <strong>35</strong> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.  <strong>36</strong> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.  <strong>37</strong> For with God nothing shall be impossible.  <strong>38</strong> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.  <strong>39</strong> And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;  <strong>40</strong> And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.  <strong>41</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:  <strong>42</strong> And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art  thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.  <strong>43</strong> And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  <strong>44</strong> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.  <strong>45</strong> And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.  <strong>46</strong> And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,  <strong>47</strong> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.  <strong>48</strong> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.  <strong>49</strong> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is  his name.  <strong>50</strong> And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.  <strong>51</strong> He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.  <strong>52</strong> He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.  <strong>53</strong> He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.  <strong>54</strong> He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his  mercy;  <strong>55</strong> As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.  <strong>56</strong> And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.  <strong>57</strong> Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.  <strong>58</strong> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.  <strong>59</strong> And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.  <strong>60</strong> And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.  <strong>61</strong> And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.  <strong>62</strong> And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.  <strong>63</strong> And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.  <strong>64</strong> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,  and he spake, and praised God.  <strong>65</strong> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.  <strong>66</strong> And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.  <strong>67</strong> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,  <strong>68</strong> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,  <strong>69</strong> And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;  <strong>70</strong> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:  <strong>71</strong> That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;  <strong>72</strong> To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;  <strong>73</strong> The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,  <strong>74</strong> That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,  <strong>75</strong> In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.  <strong>76</strong> And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  <strong>77</strong> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,  <strong>78</strong> Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,  <strong>79</strong> To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.  <strong>80</strong> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Zechariah asked the angel, \"How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When his time of service was completed, he returned home. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said. \"In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The angel went to her and said, \"Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"How will this be,\" Mary asked the angel, \"since I am a virgin?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.

And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.  <strong>3</strong> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.  <strong>4</strong> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.  <strong>5</strong> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.  <strong>6</strong> Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.  <strong>7</strong> And there was one named Barabbas, which lay  bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.  <strong>8</strong> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do  as he had ever done unto them.  <strong>9</strong> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  <strong>10</strong> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.  <strong>11</strong> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.  <strong>12</strong> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?  <strong>13</strong> And they cried out again, Crucify him.  <strong>14</strong> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.  <strong>15</strong> And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.  <strong>16</strong> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.  <strong>17</strong> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,  <strong>18</strong> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!  <strong>19</strong> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.  <strong>20</strong> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.  <strong>21</strong> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.  <strong>22</strong> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.  <strong>23</strong> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.  <strong>24</strong> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.  <strong>25</strong> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.  <strong>26</strong> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>27</strong> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.  <strong>28</strong> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.  <strong>29</strong> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,  <strong>30</strong> Save thyself, and come down from the cross.  <strong>31</strong> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.  <strong>32</strong> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.  <strong>33</strong> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.  <strong>34</strong> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <strong>35</strong> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.  <strong>36</strong> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it  on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.  <strong>37</strong> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.  <strong>38</strong> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.  <strong>39</strong> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.  <strong>40</strong> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;  <strong>41</strong> (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.  <strong>42</strong> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,  <strong>43</strong> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.  <strong>44</strong> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him  the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.  <strong>45</strong> And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.  <strong>47</strong> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate. \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The chief priests accused him of many things. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So again Pilate asked him, \"Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?\" Pilate asked them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Crucify him!\" they shouted. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And they began to call out to him, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It was the third hour when they crucified him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \"So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> come down from the cross and save yourself!\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\" Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When some of those standing near heard this, they said, \"Listen, he's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,\" he said. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, \"Surely this man was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.  <strong>14</strong> Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,  <strong>15</strong> And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.  <strong>16</strong> Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.  <strong>18</strong> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.  <strong>19</strong> And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.  <strong>20</strong> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.  <strong>21</strong> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.  <strong>22</strong> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.  <strong>23</strong> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,  <strong>24</strong> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.  <strong>25</strong> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.  <strong>26</strong> And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.  <strong>27</strong> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.  <strong>28</strong> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.  <strong>29</strong> And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.  <strong>30</strong> But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.  <strong>31</strong> And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.  <strong>32</strong> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.  <strong>33</strong> And all the city was gathered together at the door.  <strong>34</strong> And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.  <strong>35</strong> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.  <strong>36</strong> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.  <strong>37</strong> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men  seek for thee.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.  <strong>39</strong> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.  <strong>40</strong> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <strong>41</strong> And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.  <strong>42</strong> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.  <strong>43</strong> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;  <strong>44</strong> And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.  <strong>45</strong> But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.

Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And this was his message: \"After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And a voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"The time has come,\" he said. \"The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> At once they left their nets and followed him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Be quiet!\" said Jesus sternly. \"Come out of him!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \"What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The whole town gathered at the door, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Simon and his companions went to look for him, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and when they found him, they exclaimed: \"Everyone is looking for you!\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people.

Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.
