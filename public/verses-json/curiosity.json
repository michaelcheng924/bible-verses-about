And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.  <strong>16</strong> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.  <strong>17</strong> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?  <strong>18</strong> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.  <strong>19</strong> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.  <strong>20</strong> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  <strong>21</strong> And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  <strong>22</strong> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  <strong>23</strong> And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  <strong>24</strong> The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.  <strong>25</strong> Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. <strong>26</strong> And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it,  and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.  <strong>27</strong> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;  <strong>28</strong> For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.  <strong>29</strong> But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.  <strong>30</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>31</strong> Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.  <strong>32</strong> But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>33</strong> Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.  <strong>34</strong> Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>35</strong> Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.  <strong>36</strong> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.  <strong>37</strong> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.  <strong>38</strong> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.  <strong>39</strong> And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.  <strong>40</strong> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  <strong>41</strong> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>42</strong> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.  <strong>43</strong> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.  <strong>44</strong> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.  <strong>45</strong> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>46</strong> Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.  <strong>47</strong> And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.  <strong>48</strong> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.  <strong>49</strong> And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.  <strong>50</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.  <strong>51</strong> And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his  hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.  <strong>52</strong> Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  <strong>53</strong> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  <strong>54</strong> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  <strong>55</strong> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.  <strong>56</strong> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.  <strong>57</strong> And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.  <strong>58</strong> But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.  <strong>59</strong> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;  <strong>60</strong> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet  found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,  <strong>61</strong> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.  <strong>62</strong> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>63</strong> But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.  <strong>64</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>65</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.  <strong>66</strong> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.  <strong>67</strong> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,  <strong>68</strong> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?  <strong>69</strong> Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.  <strong>70</strong> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.  <strong>71</strong> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>72</strong> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.  <strong>73</strong> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.  <strong>74</strong> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.  <strong>75</strong> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.

Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.\" Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Finally two came forward and declared, \"This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, \"I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. \"But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, \"He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> What do you think?He is worthy of death,\" they answered. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> and said, \"Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?\" <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. \"You also were with Jesus of Galilee,\" she said. <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> But he denied it before them all. \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" he said. <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, \"This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> He denied it again, with an oath: \"I don't know the man!\" <sup><strong>73</strong></sup> After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \"Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away.\" <sup><strong>74</strong></sup> Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, \"I don't know the man!\" <sup><strong>75</strong></sup> Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly. "}]}
