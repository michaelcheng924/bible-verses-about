","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You and Aaron are to number by their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> One man from each tribe, each the head of his family, is to help you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> These are the names of the men who are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon; <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur; <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni; <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel; <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> These were the men appointed from the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the clans of Israel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been given, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people indicated their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai: <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Reuben was 46,500. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the descendants of Simeon: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were counted and listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Simeon was 59,300. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Gad was 45,650. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Issachar was 54,400. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Manasseh was 32,200. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> From the descendants of Benjamin: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> From the descendants of Dan: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Dan was 62,700. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> From the descendants of Asher: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel's army were counted according to their families. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The total number was 603,550. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The families of the tribe of Levi, however, were not counted along with the others. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The LORD had said to Moses: <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony-over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who goes near it shall be put to death. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his own standard. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the Testimony so that wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses.

Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a blasphemous name. The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, \"Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty-two months. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast--all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he will be killed. This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.
