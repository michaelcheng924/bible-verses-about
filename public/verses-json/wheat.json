This is he which received seed by the way side.  <strong>20</strong> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  <strong>21</strong> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.  <strong>22</strong> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  <strong>23</strong> But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. <strong>24</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:  <strong>25</strong> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.  <strong>26</strong> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.  <strong>27</strong> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  <strong>28</strong> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.

Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <strong>44</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. <strong>45</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:  <strong>46</strong> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. <strong>47</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:  <strong>48</strong> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.  <strong>49</strong> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  <strong>50</strong> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>51</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?  They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  <strong>52</strong> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is  instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. <strong>53</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.  <strong>54</strong> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  <strong>55</strong> Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  <strong>56</strong> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?  <strong>57</strong> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.  <strong>58</strong> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then he told them many things in parables, saying: \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He who has ears, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The disciples came to him and asked, \"Why do you speak to the people in parables?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He replied, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is why I speak to them in parables: \"Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: \"'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"'An enemy did this,' he replied. \"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"Have you understood all these things?\" Jesus asked. \"Yes,\" they replied. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\" they asked. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> \"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.  <strong>28</strong> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.  <strong>29</strong> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.  <strong>30</strong> Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.  <strong>31</strong> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.  <strong>32</strong> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men  unto me.  <strong>33</strong> This he said, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>34</strong> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up?  who is this Son of man?  <strong>35</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.  <strong>36</strong> While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.  <strong>37</strong> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:  <strong>38</strong> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  <strong>39</strong> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,  <strong>40</strong> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.  <strong>41</strong> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.  <strong>42</strong> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:  <strong>43</strong> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.  <strong>44</strong> Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.  <strong>45</strong> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.  <strong>46</strong> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.  <strong>47</strong> And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.  <strong>48</strong> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.  <strong>49</strong> For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.  <strong>50</strong> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages. \" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" Jesus replied. \"It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, \"Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!Blessed is the King of Israel!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the Pharisees said to one another, \"See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. \"Sir,\" they said, \"we would like to see Jesus.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Father, glorify your name!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then a voice came from heaven, \"I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.\" The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"This voice was for your benefit, not mine. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The crowd spoke up, \"We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus told them, \"You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light.\" When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: \"Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then Jesus cried out, \"When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.\" "},{"_id":"616d7a39e9d39d04b3b6078f","topicId":"616d7a34e9d39d04b3b60783","verse":"Matthew 15:11","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40015011_01-12\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40015011-1\">11&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.”</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>11</strong> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  <strong>29</strong> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.  <strong>30</strong> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. <strong>31</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:  <strong>32</strong> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <strong>33</strong> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  <strong>34</strong> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  <strong>35</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  <strong>36</strong> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;  <strong>38</strong> The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;  <strong>39</strong> The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  <strong>40</strong> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.  <strong>41</strong> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;  <strong>42</strong> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>43</strong> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
