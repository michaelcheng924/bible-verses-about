this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.  <strong>12</strong> Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.  <strong>13</strong> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.  <strong>14</strong> These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.  <strong>15</strong> And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)  <strong>16</strong> Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.  <strong>17</strong> For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.  <strong>18</strong> Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.  <strong>19</strong> And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.  <strong>20</strong> For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.  <strong>21</strong> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,  <strong>22</strong> Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.  <strong>23</strong> And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.  <strong>24</strong> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,  <strong>25</strong> That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.  <strong>26</strong> And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So when they met together, they asked him, \"Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He said to them: \"It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Men of Galilee,\" they said, \"why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and said, \"Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus-- <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> he was one of our number and shared in this ministry.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"For,\" said Peter, \"it is written in the book of Psalms, \"'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, \"'May another take his place of leadership.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then they prayed, \"Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.

Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.  <strong>12</strong> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.  <strong>14</strong> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.  <strong>15</strong> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.  <strong>16</strong> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,  <strong>17</strong> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.  <strong>18</strong> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.  <strong>19</strong> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.  <strong>20</strong> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.  <strong>21</strong> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.  <strong>22</strong> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;  <strong>23</strong> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)  <strong>24</strong> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.  <strong>25</strong> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.  <strong>27</strong> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  <strong>28</strong> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  <strong>29</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  <strong>30</strong> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  <strong>31</strong> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  <strong>33</strong> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.  <strong>34</strong> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  <strong>36</strong> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.  <strong>37</strong> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  <strong>38</strong> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.  <strong>39</strong> And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.  <strong>40</strong> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>41</strong> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.  <strong>42</strong> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?  <strong>43</strong> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.  <strong>44</strong> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>45</strong> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.  <strong>47</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.  <strong>48</strong> I am that bread of life.  <strong>49</strong> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  <strong>50</strong> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.  <strong>51</strong> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.  <strong>52</strong> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  <strong>53</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.  <strong>54</strong> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>55</strong> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.  <strong>56</strong> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.  <strong>57</strong> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.  <strong>58</strong> This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.  <strong>59</strong> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.  <strong>60</strong> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,  said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  <strong>61</strong> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?  <strong>62</strong> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  <strong>63</strong> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.  <strong>64</strong> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.  <strong>65</strong> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. <strong>66</strong> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  <strong>67</strong> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  <strong>68</strong> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.  <strong>69</strong> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>70</strong> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?  <strong>71</strong> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Jewish Passover Feast was near. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Philip answered him, \"Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"from now on give us this bread.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> I am the bread of life. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve?

Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:  <strong>18</strong> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.  <strong>19</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.  <strong>20</strong> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  <strong>21</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.  <strong>22</strong> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.  <strong>23</strong> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.  <strong>24</strong> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.  <strong>25</strong> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.  <strong>26</strong> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <strong>27</strong> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?  <strong>28</strong> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,  <strong>29</strong> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?  <strong>30</strong> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.  <strong>31</strong> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.  <strong>32</strong> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.  <strong>35</strong> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.  <strong>36</strong> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.  <strong>37</strong> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.  <strong>38</strong> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. <strong>39</strong> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.  <strong>40</strong> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.  <strong>41</strong> And many more believed because of his own word;  <strong>42</strong> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.  <strong>43</strong> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.  <strong>44</strong> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.  <strong>45</strong> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.  <strong>46</strong> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.  <strong>47</strong> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.  <strong>48</strong> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.  <strong>49</strong> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  <strong>51</strong> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,  saying, Thy son liveth.  <strong>52</strong> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  <strong>53</strong> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  <strong>54</strong> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Now he had to go through Samaria. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \"Will you give me a drink?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ) <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I have no husband,\" she replied. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus declared, \"Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They came out of the town and made their way toward him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Meanwhile his disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat something.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And because of his words many more became believers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the two days he left for Galilee. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" The man took Jesus at his word and departed. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and all his household believed. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.

And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.  <strong>15</strong> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.  <strong>16</strong> And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  <strong>17</strong> Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  <strong>18</strong> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.  <strong>19</strong> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:  <strong>20</strong> These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. <strong>21</strong> Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.  <strong>23</strong> But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.  <strong>24</strong> But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  <strong>25</strong> Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.  <strong>26</strong> But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.  <strong>27</strong> And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.  <strong>28</strong> Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is  thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.  <strong>30</strong> And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:  <strong>31</strong> Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.  <strong>33</strong> And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  <strong>34</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.  <strong>35</strong> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.  <strong>36</strong> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  <strong>37</strong> And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.  <strong>38</strong> And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.  <strong>39</strong> And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala,  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders?

Your request is granted.\" And her daughter was healed from that very hour. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus called his disciples to him and said, \"I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> His disciples answered, \"Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"How many loaves do you have?\" Jesus asked. \"Seven,\" they replied, \"and a few small fish.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The number of those who ate was four thousand, besides women and children. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.

Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?  <strong>12</strong> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  <strong>13</strong> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that  thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  <strong>15</strong> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  <strong>16</strong> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  <strong>17</strong> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;  <strong>18</strong> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;  <strong>19</strong> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  <strong>20</strong> And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.  <strong>21</strong> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  <strong>22</strong> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  <strong>23</strong> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  <strong>24</strong> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> To Adam he said, \"Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,'\"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
