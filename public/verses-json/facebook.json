Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do your best to come to me quickly, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.  <strong>20</strong> But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.  <strong>21</strong> But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: \"The man who does these things will live by them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the righteousness that is by faith says: \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'\" (that is, to bring Christ down) <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"or 'Who will descend into the deep?'\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But what does it say? \"The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,\" that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> That if you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As the Scripture says, \"Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for, \"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, \"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, \"Lord, who has believed our message?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: \"Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, \"I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And Isaiah boldly says, \"I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But concerning Israel he says, \"All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.\" "},{"_id":"61609deaa775948f9a152f42","topicId":"61609de2a775948f9a152f29","verse":"John 14:12-15","votes":7,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43014012_01-31\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43014012-1\">12&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43014013-1\">13&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43014014-1\">14&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.</span></p>\n\n<p id=\"p43014014_06-31\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43014015-1\">15&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.</span></p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>12</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.  <strong>13</strong> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  <strong>14</strong> If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. <strong>15</strong>           If ye love me, keep my commandments.
