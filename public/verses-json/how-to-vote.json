You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.' <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden.

They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"It is written,\" he said to them, \"'My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.'\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.

There he was transfigured before them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Peter said to Jesus, \"Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.) <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: \"This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what \"rising from the dead\" meant. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And they asked him, \"Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"What are you arguing with them about?\" he asked. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> A man in the crowd answered, \"Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"O unbelieving generation,\" Jesus replied, \"how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus asked the boy's father, \"How long has he been like this?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"From childhood,\" he answered. \"It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"'If you can'?\" said Jesus. \"Everything is possible for him who believes.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, \"I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. \"You deaf and mute spirit,\" he said, \"I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, \"He's dead.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, \"Why couldn't we drive it out?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He replied, \"This kind can come out only by prayer. \" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, \"What were you arguing about on the road?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, \"If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" said John, \"we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Do not stop him,\" Jesus said. \"No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> for whoever is not against us is for us. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off.

 <strong>20</strong> Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.  <strong>21</strong> And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein.  <strong>22</strong> And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.  <strong>23</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters  of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.  <strong>24</strong> Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.  <strong>25</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.  <strong>26</strong> Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.  <strong>27</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.  <strong>28</strong> Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  <strong>29</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,  <strong>30</strong> And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.  <strong>31</strong> Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.  <strong>32</strong> Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.  <strong>33</strong> Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? <strong>34</strong>           Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:  <strong>35</strong> That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.  <strong>36</strong> Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.  <strong>37</strong> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!  <strong>38</strong> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.  <strong>39</strong> For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.

But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Everything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them 'Rabbi.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Master and you are all brothers. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The greatest among you will be your servant. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You blind men! Which is greater: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers! <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell? <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers.
