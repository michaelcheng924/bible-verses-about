And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.  <strong>4</strong> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.  <strong>5</strong> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.  <strong>6</strong> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.  <strong>7</strong> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.  <strong>8</strong> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.  <strong>10</strong> These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:  <strong>11</strong> And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>12</strong> And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:  <strong>13</strong> And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>14</strong> And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:  <strong>15</strong> And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>16</strong> And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:  <strong>17</strong> And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>18</strong> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:  <strong>19</strong> And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>20</strong> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:  <strong>21</strong> And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>22</strong> And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:  <strong>23</strong> And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>24</strong> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:  <strong>25</strong> And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.  <strong>26</strong> And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.  <strong>27</strong> Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.  <strong>28</strong> And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.  <strong>29</strong> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.  <strong>30</strong> But Sarai was barren; she had no child.  <strong>31</strong> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.  <strong>32</strong> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
