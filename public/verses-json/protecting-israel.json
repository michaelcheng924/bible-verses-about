You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> However, if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you: <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The LORD will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The LORD will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> At midday you will grope about like a blind man in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and ravish her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The sights you see will drive you mad. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your fathers. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You will become a thing of horror and an object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations where the LORD will drive you. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, but you will be the tail. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The most gentle and sensitive woman among you-so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot-will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name-the LORD your God- <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods-gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> In the morning you will say, \"If only it were evening!\" and in the evening, \"If only it were morning!\"-because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.

For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  <strong>2</strong> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,  <strong>3</strong> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  <strong>4</strong> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of  Baal.  <strong>5</strong> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <strong>6</strong> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.  <strong>7</strong> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded  <strong>8</strong> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  <strong>10</strong> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  <strong>11</strong> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  <strong>12</strong> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?  <strong>13</strong> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  <strong>14</strong> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them.  <strong>15</strong> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  <strong>16</strong> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  <strong>17</strong> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  <strong>18</strong> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.  <strong>20</strong> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  <strong>21</strong> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.  <strong>22</strong> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  <strong>23</strong> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  <strong>24</strong> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?  <strong>25</strong> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  <strong>26</strong> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  <strong>27</strong> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  <strong>28</strong> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.  <strong>29</strong> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.  <strong>30</strong> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  <strong>31</strong> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  <strong>32</strong> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  <strong>33</strong> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  <strong>34</strong> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  <strong>35</strong> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  <strong>36</strong> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me\"? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And what was God's answer to him? \"I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> as it is written: \"God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And David says: \"May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You will say then, \"Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: \"The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out! <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.

have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.  <strong>2</strong> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.  <strong>3</strong> For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.  <strong>4</strong> Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.  <strong>5</strong> Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;  <strong>6</strong> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;  <strong>7</strong> Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.  <strong>8</strong> Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.  <strong>9</strong> Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.  <strong>10</strong> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.  <strong>11</strong> I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is  no saviour.  <strong>12</strong> I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was  no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.  <strong>13</strong> Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is  none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?  <strong>14</strong> Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.  <strong>15</strong> I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.  <strong>16</strong> Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;  <strong>17</strong> Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.  <strong>18</strong> Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.  <strong>19</strong> Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.  <strong>20</strong> The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.  <strong>21</strong> This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.  <strong>22</strong> But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.  <strong>23</strong> Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.  <strong>24</strong> Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.  <strong>25</strong> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.  <strong>26</strong> Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.  <strong>27</strong> Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.  <strong>28</strong> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> But now, this is what the LORD says- he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel: \"Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For I am the LORD, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your stead. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you, and people in exchange for your life. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.' Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth- <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Which of them foretold this and proclaimed to us the former things? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right, so that others may hear and say, \"It is true.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are my witnesses,\" declares the LORD, \"and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have revealed and saved and proclaimed- I, and not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses,\" declares the LORD, \"that I am God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Yes, and from ancient days I am he. No one can deliver out of my hand. When I act, who can reverse it?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says- your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: \"For your sake I will send to Babylon and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians, in the ships in which they took pride. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I am the LORD, your Holy One, Israel's Creator, your King.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says- he who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> who drew out the chariots and horses, the army and reinforcements together, and they lay there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, O Israel. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Review the past for me, let us argue the matter together; state the case for your innocence. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Your first father sinned; your spokesmen rebelled against me. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So I will disgrace the dignitaries of your temple, and I will consign Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.
