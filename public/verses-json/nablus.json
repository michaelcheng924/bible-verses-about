me.  <strong>6</strong> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.  <strong>7</strong> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.  <strong>8</strong> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  <strong>9</strong> He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was  under his feet.  <strong>10</strong> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.  <strong>11</strong> He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.  <strong>12</strong> At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.  <strong>14</strong> Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.  <strong>15</strong> Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.  <strong>16</strong> He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.  <strong>17</strong> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.  <strong>18</strong> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  <strong>19</strong> He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  <strong>20</strong> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  <strong>21</strong> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  <strong>22</strong> For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.  <strong>23</strong> I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.  <strong>25</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;  <strong>26</strong> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.  <strong>27</strong> For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.  <strong>28</strong> For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.  <strong>29</strong> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.  <strong>30</strong>             As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.  <strong>31</strong> For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?  <strong>32</strong>             It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.  <strong>33</strong> He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.  <strong>34</strong> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  <strong>35</strong> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.  <strong>36</strong> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.  <strong>37</strong> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.  <strong>38</strong> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.  <strong>39</strong> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  <strong>40</strong> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.  <strong>41</strong> They cried, but there was none to save them: even  unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  <strong>42</strong> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.  <strong>43</strong> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and  thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom  I have not known shall serve me.  <strong>44</strong> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the

Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior! <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> who saves me from my enemies.

LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:  <strong>2</strong> And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;  <strong>3</strong> The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.  <strong>4</strong> I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  <strong>5</strong> When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;  <strong>6</strong> The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;  <strong>7</strong> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.  <strong>8</strong> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.  <strong>9</strong> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  <strong>10</strong> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was  under his feet.  <strong>11</strong> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.  <strong>12</strong> And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and  thick clouds of the skies.  <strong>13</strong> Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.  <strong>15</strong> And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.  <strong>16</strong> And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.  <strong>17</strong> He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;  <strong>18</strong> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.  <strong>19</strong> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  <strong>20</strong> He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  <strong>22</strong> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  <strong>23</strong> For all his judgments were before me: and as for  his statutes, I did not depart from them.  <strong>24</strong> I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.  <strong>26</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.  <strong>27</strong> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.  <strong>28</strong> And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are  upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.  <strong>29</strong> For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.  <strong>30</strong> For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.  <strong>31</strong> As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.  <strong>32</strong> For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?  <strong>33</strong> God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.  <strong>34</strong> He maketh my feet like hinds feet: and setteth me upon my high places.  <strong>35</strong> He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  <strong>36</strong> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.  <strong>37</strong> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.  <strong>38</strong> I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.  <strong>39</strong> And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.  <strong>40</strong> For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.  <strong>41</strong> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.  <strong>42</strong> They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  <strong>43</strong> Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.  <strong>44</strong> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.  <strong>45</strong> Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.  <strong>47</strong> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.  <strong>48</strong> It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,  <strong>49</strong> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  <strong>50</strong> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.  <strong>51</strong> He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.  <strong>13</strong> And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.  <strong>14</strong> Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.  <strong>15</strong> And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.  <strong>16</strong> And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of  pure gold.  <strong>17</strong> And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same:  <strong>18</strong> And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:  <strong>19</strong> Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.  <strong>20</strong> And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:  <strong>21</strong> And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.  <strong>22</strong> Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was  one beaten work of pure gold.  <strong>23</strong> And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold.  <strong>24</strong> Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.  <strong>25</strong> And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was  foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.  <strong>26</strong> And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.  <strong>27</strong> And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal.  <strong>28</strong> And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.  <strong>29</strong> And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.  <strong>1</strong> And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.  <strong>2</strong> And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.  <strong>3</strong> And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.  <strong>4</strong> And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.  <strong>5</strong> And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves.  <strong>6</strong> And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass.  <strong>7</strong> And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.  <strong>8</strong> And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of  brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  <strong>9</strong> And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:  <strong>10</strong> Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.  <strong>11</strong> And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.  <strong>12</strong> And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.  <strong>13</strong> And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.  <strong>14</strong> The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.  <strong>15</strong> And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.  <strong>16</strong> All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.  <strong>17</strong> And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were  filleted with silver.  <strong>18</strong> And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was  five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.  <strong>19</strong> And their pillars were four, and their sockets of  brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver.  <strong>20</strong> And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass.  <strong>21</strong> This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.  <strong>22</strong> And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>23</strong> And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.  <strong>24</strong> All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.  <strong>25</strong> And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:  <strong>26</strong> A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.  <strong>27</strong> And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.  <strong>28</strong> And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels  he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them.  <strong>29</strong> And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.  <strong>30</strong> And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,  <strong>31</strong> And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.  <strong>1</strong> And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>2</strong> And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.  <strong>3</strong> And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into  wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.  <strong>4</strong> They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.  <strong>5</strong> And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>6</strong> And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be  stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>8</strong> And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.  <strong>9</strong> It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was  the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being  doubled.  <strong>10</strong> And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.  <strong>11</strong> And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.  <strong>12</strong> And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.  <strong>13</strong> And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were  inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.  <strong>14</strong> And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.  <strong>15</strong> And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of  wreathen work of pure gold.  <strong>16</strong> And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.  <strong>17</strong> And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate.  <strong>18</strong> And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it.  <strong>19</strong> And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.  <strong>20</strong> And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.  <strong>21</strong> And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>22</strong> And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.  <strong>23</strong> And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.  <strong>24</strong> And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.  <strong>25</strong> And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;  <strong>26</strong> A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>27</strong> And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,  <strong>28</strong> And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of  fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen,  <strong>29</strong> And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>30</strong> And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.  <strong>31</strong> And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>32</strong> Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.  <strong>33</strong> And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets,  <strong>34</strong> And the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers’ skins, and the vail of the covering,  <strong>35</strong> The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,  <strong>36</strong> The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,  <strong>37</strong> The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with  the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,  <strong>38</strong> And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,  <strong>39</strong> The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,  <strong>40</strong> The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation,  <strong>41</strong> The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons’ garments, to minister in the priest’s office.  <strong>42</strong> According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.  <strong>43</strong> And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they have done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.  <strong>1</strong> And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  <strong>2</strong> On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.  <strong>3</strong> And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.  <strong>4</strong> And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.  <strong>5</strong> And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.  <strong>6</strong> And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.  <strong>7</strong> And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.  <strong>8</strong> And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.  <strong>9</strong> And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.  <strong>10</strong> And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.  <strong>11</strong> And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.  <strong>12</strong> And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.  <strong>13</strong> And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office.  <strong>14</strong> And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:  <strong>15</strong> And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.  <strong>16</strong> Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.  <strong>18</strong> And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.  <strong>19</strong> And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>20</strong> And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:  <strong>21</strong> And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>22</strong> And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.  <strong>23</strong> And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses.  <strong>24</strong> And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.  <strong>25</strong> And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>26</strong> And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:  <strong>27</strong> And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>28</strong> And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.  <strong>29</strong> And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>30</strong> And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.  <strong>31</strong> And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:  <strong>32</strong> When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>33</strong> And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.  <strong>34</strong> Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  <strong>35</strong> And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.  <strong>36</strong> And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:  <strong>37</strong> But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.  <strong>38</strong> For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, \"These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Moses said to the whole Israelite community, \"This is what the LORD has commanded: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> From what you have, take an offering for the LORD. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the LORD an offering of gold, silver and bronze; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> ram skins dyed red and hides of sea cows; acacia wood; <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the LORD has commanded: <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light; <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand; <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes; <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary-both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses' presence, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or hides of sea cows brought them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the LORD, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun-blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Moses said to the Israelites, \"See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts- <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic craftsmanship. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as craftsmen, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers-all of them master craftsmen and designers. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> undefined <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> undefined "},{"_id":"6168c4ea3b32607a097c13e4","topicId":"6168c4e63b32607a097c13d8","verse":"Exodus 20:1-26","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p02020001_04-12\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v02020001-1\">20:1&nbsp;</b>And God spoke all these words, saying,</p>\n<p id=\"p02020001_04-12\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.</p>\n<p id=\"p02020002_04-12\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>“You shall have no other gods before me.</p>\n<p id=\"p02020003_04-12\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p>\n<p id=\"p02020006_04-12\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</p>\n<p id=\"p02020007_04-12\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v02020010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God.

And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them.

Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  <strong>34</strong> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  <strong>35</strong> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  <strong>36</strong> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  <strong>37</strong> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <strong>38</strong> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  <strong>39</strong> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  <strong>40</strong> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  <strong>41</strong> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  <strong>42</strong> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  <strong>43</strong> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  <strong>44</strong> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  <strong>45</strong> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>46</strong> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.

Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.  <strong>7</strong> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.  <strong>8</strong> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  <strong>9</strong> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.  <strong>11</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?  <strong>12</strong> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  <strong>13</strong> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:  <strong>14</strong> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.  <strong>15</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.  <strong>16</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.  <strong>17</strong> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:  <strong>18</strong> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.  <strong>19</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.  <strong>20</strong> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  <strong>21</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.  <strong>22</strong> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.  <strong>23</strong> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.  <strong>24</strong> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.  <strong>25</strong> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.  <strong>26</strong> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <strong>27</strong> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?  <strong>28</strong> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,  <strong>29</strong> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?  <strong>30</strong> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.  <strong>31</strong> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.  <strong>32</strong> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.  <strong>35</strong> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.  <strong>36</strong> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.  <strong>37</strong> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.  <strong>38</strong> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. <strong>39</strong> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.  <strong>40</strong> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.  <strong>41</strong> And many more believed because of his own word;  <strong>42</strong> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.  <strong>43</strong> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.  <strong>44</strong> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.  <strong>45</strong> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.  <strong>46</strong> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.  <strong>47</strong> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.  <strong>48</strong> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.  <strong>49</strong> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  <strong>51</strong> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,  saying, Thy son liveth.  <strong>52</strong> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  <strong>53</strong> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  <strong>54</strong> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Now he had to go through Samaria. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \"Will you give me a drink?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ) <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I have no husband,\" she replied. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus declared, \"Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They came out of the town and made their way toward him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Meanwhile his disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat something.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And because of his words many more became believers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the two days he left for Galilee. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" The man took Jesus at his word and departed. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and all his household believed. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.
