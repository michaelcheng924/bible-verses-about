but let thine heart keep my commandments:  <strong>2</strong> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.  <strong>3</strong> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:  <strong>4</strong> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.  <strong>5</strong> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  <strong>6</strong> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  <strong>7</strong> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.  <strong>8</strong> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.  <strong>9</strong> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:  <strong>10</strong> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.  <strong>11</strong> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:  <strong>12</strong> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.  <strong>13</strong> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.  <strong>14</strong> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.  <strong>15</strong> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.  <strong>16</strong> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.  <strong>17</strong> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.  <strong>18</strong> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.  <strong>19</strong> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.  <strong>20</strong> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.  <strong>21</strong> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:  <strong>22</strong> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.  <strong>23</strong> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.  <strong>24</strong> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.  <strong>25</strong> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.  <strong>26</strong> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.  <strong>27</strong> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.  <strong>28</strong> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.  <strong>29</strong> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.  <strong>30</strong> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.  <strong>31</strong> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.  <strong>32</strong> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.  <strong>33</strong> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.  <strong>34</strong> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.  <strong>35</strong> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.  <strong>1</strong> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.  <strong>2</strong> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.  <strong>3</strong> For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.  <strong>4</strong> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.  <strong>5</strong> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.  <strong>6</strong> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.  <strong>7</strong> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.  <strong>8</strong> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.  <strong>9</strong> She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.  <strong>10</strong> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.  <strong>11</strong> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.  <strong>12</strong> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.  <strong>13</strong> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.  <strong>14</strong> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.  <strong>15</strong> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.  <strong>16</strong> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.  <strong>17</strong> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.  <strong>18</strong> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.  <strong>19</strong> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.  <strong>20</strong> My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.  <strong>21</strong> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.  <strong>22</strong> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.  <strong>23</strong> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.  <strong>24</strong> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.  <strong>25</strong> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.  <strong>26</strong> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.  <strong>27</strong> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.  <strong>1</strong> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:  <strong>2</strong> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.  <strong>3</strong> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:  <strong>4</strong> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.  <strong>5</strong> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.  <strong>6</strong> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.  <strong>7</strong> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.  <strong>8</strong> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:  <strong>9</strong> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:  <strong>10</strong> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be  in the house of a stranger;  <strong>11</strong> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,  <strong>12</strong> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;  <strong>13</strong> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!  <strong>14</strong> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.  <strong>15</strong> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.  <strong>16</strong> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.  <strong>17</strong> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.  <strong>18</strong> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.  <strong>19</strong> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.  <strong>20</strong> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?  <strong>21</strong> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.  <strong>22</strong> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.  <strong>23</strong> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.  <strong>1</strong> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,  <strong>2</strong> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.  <strong>3</strong> Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.  <strong>4</strong> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.  <strong>5</strong> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.  <strong>6</strong> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:  <strong>7</strong> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  <strong>8</strong> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.  <strong>9</strong> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?  <strong>10</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>11</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.  <strong>12</strong> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.  <strong>13</strong> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;  <strong>14</strong> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.  <strong>16</strong> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are  an abomination unto him:  <strong>17</strong> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,  <strong>18</strong> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,  <strong>19</strong> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.  <strong>20</strong> My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:  <strong>21</strong> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.  <strong>22</strong> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.  <strong>23</strong> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:  <strong>24</strong> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  <strong>25</strong> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.  <strong>26</strong> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.  <strong>27</strong> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?  <strong>28</strong> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  <strong>29</strong> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.  <strong>30</strong> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;  <strong>31</strong> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.  <strong>32</strong> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.  <strong>33</strong> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.  <strong>34</strong> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  <strong>35</strong> He will not regard any ransom;
