The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning.

But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.

This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

and he stood in the gate.  <strong>4</strong> And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.  <strong>5</strong> And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.  <strong>6</strong> Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was  one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was  one reed broad.  <strong>7</strong> And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.  <strong>8</strong> He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.  <strong>9</strong> Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.  <strong>10</strong> And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.  <strong>11</strong> And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.  <strong>12</strong> The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.  <strong>13</strong> He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against door.  <strong>14</strong> He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.  <strong>15</strong> And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.  <strong>16</strong> And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.  <strong>17</strong> Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were  chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.  <strong>18</strong> And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement.  <strong>19</strong> Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits eastward and northward.  <strong>20</strong> And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.  <strong>21</strong> And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.  <strong>22</strong> And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were  after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.  <strong>23</strong> And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits.  <strong>24</strong> After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.  <strong>25</strong> And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.  <strong>26</strong> And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.  <strong>27</strong> And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.  <strong>28</strong> And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;  <strong>29</strong> And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.  <strong>30</strong> And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.  <strong>31</strong> And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.  <strong>32</strong> And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures.  <strong>33</strong> And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were  windows therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was  fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.  <strong>34</strong> And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.  <strong>35</strong> And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to these measures;  <strong>36</strong> The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.  <strong>37</strong> And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.  <strong>38</strong> And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.  <strong>39</strong> And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering.  <strong>40</strong> And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.  <strong>41</strong> Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.  <strong>42</strong> And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.  <strong>43</strong> And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.  <strong>44</strong> And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.  <strong>45</strong> And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.  <strong>46</strong> And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is  for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.  <strong>47</strong> So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.  <strong>48</strong> And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each  post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.  <strong>49</strong> The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.  <strong>1</strong> Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was  the breadth of the tabernacle.  <strong>2</strong> And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.  <strong>3</strong> Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.  <strong>4</strong> So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.  <strong>5</strong> After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side.  <strong>6</strong> And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.  <strong>7</strong> And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.  <strong>8</strong> I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.  <strong>9</strong> The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was  left was the place of the side chambers that were  within.  <strong>10</strong> And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.  <strong>11</strong> And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.  <strong>12</strong> Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.  <strong>13</strong> So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long;  <strong>14</strong> Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits.  <strong>15</strong> And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;  <strong>16</strong> The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;  <strong>17</strong> To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.  <strong>18</strong> And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;  <strong>19</strong> So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about.  <strong>20</strong> From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple.  <strong>21</strong> The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.  <strong>22</strong> The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is  the table that is before the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.  <strong>24</strong> And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.  <strong>25</strong> And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.  <strong>26</strong> And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city-on that very day the hand of the LORD was upon me and he took me there. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> In visions of God he took me to the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, on whose south side were some buildings that looked like a city. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He took me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man said to me, \"Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for that is why you have been brought here. Tell the house of Israel everything you see.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I saw a wall completely surrounding the temple area. The length of the measuring rod in the man's hand was six long cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one measuring rod thick and one rod high. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then he went to the gate facing east. He climbed its steps and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The alcoves for the guards were one rod long and one rod wide, and the projecting walls between the alcoves were five cubits thick. And the threshold of the gate next to the portico facing the temple was one rod deep. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then he measured the portico of the gateway; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> it was eight cubits deep and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced the temple. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Inside the east gate were three alcoves on each side; the three had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then he measured the width of the entrance to the gateway; it was ten cubits and its length was thirteen cubits. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> In front of each alcove was a wall one cubit high, and the alcoves were six cubits square. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then he measured the gateway from the top of the rear wall of one alcove to the top of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one parapet opening to the opposite one. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He measured along the faces of the projecting walls all around the inside of the gateway-sixty cubits. The measurement was up to the portico facing the courtyard. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its portico was fifty cubits. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The alcoves and the projecting walls inside the gateway were surmounted by narrow parapet openings all around, as was the portico; the openings all around faced inward. The faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then he brought me into the outer court. There I saw some rooms and a pavement that had been constructed all around the court; there were thirty rooms along the pavement. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It abutted the sides of the gateways and was as wide as they were long; this was the lower pavement. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then he measured the distance from the inside of the lower gateway to the outside of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on the east side as well as on the north. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then he measured the length and width of the gate facing north, leading into the outer court. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Its alcoves-three on each side-its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Its openings, its portico and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> There was a gate to the inner court facing the north gate, just as there was on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then he led me to the south side and I saw a gate facing south. He measured its jambs and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The gateway and its portico had narrow openings all around, like the openings of the others. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Seven steps led up to it, with its portico opposite them; it had palm tree decorations on the faces of the projecting walls on each side. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; it was a hundred cubits. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then he brought me into the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> (The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court were twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its jambs, and eight steps led up to it. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same measurements as the others. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same measurements as the others, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> as did its alcoves, its projecting walls and its portico, and it had openings all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the jambs on either side, and eight steps led up to it. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> A room with a doorway was by the portico in each of the inner gateways, where the burnt offerings were washed. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, on which the burnt offerings, sin offerings and guilt offerings were slaughtered. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> By the outside wall of the portico of the gateway, near the steps at the entrance to the north gateway were two tables, and on the other side of the steps were two tables. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other-eight tables in all-on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.

And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <strong>4</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <strong>6</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <strong>7</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.

And to this day it is said, \"On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and said, \"I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Some time later Abraham was told, \"Milcah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram), <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.

The sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, \"Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Pathrusites, Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. The Semites <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshech. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Obal, Abimael, Sheba, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> These are the clans of Noah's sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
