For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.  <strong>2</strong> Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.  <strong>3</strong> For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.

But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.  <strong>5</strong> Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.  <strong>6</strong> For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.  <strong>7</strong> Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due;  custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.  <strong>8</strong> Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.  <strong>9</strong> For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <strong>10</strong> Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.  <strong>11</strong> And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.  <strong>12</strong> The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.  <strong>13</strong> Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.  <strong>14</strong> But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The commandments, \"Do not commit adultery,Do not murder,Do not steal,Do not covet,\" and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.

Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?  <strong>7</strong> Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:  <strong>8</strong> Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread  of sincerity and truth.  <strong>9</strong> I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:  <strong>10</strong> Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.  <strong>11</strong> But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.  <strong>12</strong> For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?  <strong>13</strong> But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.  <strong>1</strong> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?  <strong>2</strong> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  <strong>3</strong> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?  <strong>4</strong> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.  <strong>5</strong> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?  <strong>6</strong> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.  <strong>7</strong> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  <strong>8</strong> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.  <strong>9</strong> Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  <strong>10</strong> Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  <strong>11</strong> And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.  <strong>12</strong> All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.  <strong>13</strong> Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.  <strong>14</strong> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.  <strong>15</strong> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.  <strong>16</strong> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.  <strong>17</strong> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.  <strong>18</strong> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.  <strong>19</strong> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  <strong>20</strong> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.  <strong>1</strong> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is  good for a man not to touch a woman.  <strong>2</strong> Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.  <strong>3</strong> Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.  <strong>4</strong> The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.  <strong>5</strong> Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.  <strong>6</strong> But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.  <strong>7</strong> For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, \"Do not go beyond what is written.\" Then you will not take pride in one man over against another. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?
