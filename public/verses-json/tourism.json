And Balak also went his way.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.  <strong>2</strong> And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.  <strong>3</strong> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:  <strong>4</strong> He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:  <strong>5</strong> How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!  <strong>6</strong> As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.  <strong>7</strong> He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be  in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.  <strong>8</strong> God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.  <strong>9</strong> He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.  <strong>10</strong> And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.  <strong>12</strong> And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,  <strong>13</strong> If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?  <strong>14</strong> And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and  I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.  <strong>15</strong> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:  <strong>16</strong> He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:  <strong>17</strong> I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.  <strong>18</strong> And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.  <strong>19</strong> Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city.  <strong>20</strong> And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be  that he perish for ever.  <strong>21</strong> And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.  <strong>22</strong> Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.  <strong>23</strong> And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this!  <strong>24</strong> And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.  <strong>25</strong> And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward the desert. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and he uttered his oracle: \"The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel! <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. \"Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness-who dares to rouse them? \"May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, \"I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Balaam answered Balak, \"Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> 'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD -and I must say only what the LORD says'? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then he uttered his oracle: \"The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle: \"Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle: \"Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock; <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he uttered his oracle: \"Ah, who can live when God does this? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then Balaam got up and returned home and Balak went his own way.
