Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.  <strong>6</strong> Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.  <strong>7</strong> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.  <strong>8</strong> But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is  a doctrine of vanities.  <strong>9</strong> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.  <strong>10</strong> But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.  <strong>11</strong> Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.  <strong>12</strong> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.  <strong>13</strong> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.  <strong>14</strong> Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.  <strong>15</strong> They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.  <strong>16</strong> The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is  the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>17</strong> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.  <strong>18</strong> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it  so.  <strong>19</strong> Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.  <strong>20</strong> My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.  <strong>21</strong> For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.  <strong>22</strong> Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.  <strong>23</strong> O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.  <strong>24</strong> O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.  <strong>25</strong> Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.

Do not fear them; they can do no harm nor can they do any good.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> No one is like you, O LORD; you are great, and your name is mighty in power. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Who should not revere you, O King of the nations? This is your due. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> They are all senseless and foolish; they are taught by worthless wooden idols. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz. What the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple- all made by skilled workers. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. When he is angry, the earth trembles; the nations cannot endure his wrath. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Tell them this: 'These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But God made the earth by his power; he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar; he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Everyone is senseless and without knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols. His images are a fraud; they have no breath in them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> They are worthless, the objects of mockery; when their judgment comes, they will perish. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these, for he is the Maker of all things, including Israel, the tribe of his inheritance- the LORD Almighty is his name. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Gather up your belongings to leave the land, you who live under siege. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this is what the LORD says: \"At this time I will hurl out those who live in this land; I will bring distress on them so that they may be captured.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Woe to me because of my injury! My wound is incurable! Yet I said to myself, \"This is my sickness, and I must endure it.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> My tent is destroyed; all its ropes are snapped. My sons are gone from me and are no more; no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the LORD; so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Listen! The report is coming- a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I know, O LORD, that a man's life is not his own; it is not for man to direct his steps. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Correct me, LORD, but only with justice- not in your anger, lest you reduce me to nothing. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the peoples who do not call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland.
