A certain  man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it,  and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.  <strong>2</strong> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.  <strong>3</strong> And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.  <strong>4</strong> And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him  away shamefully handled.  <strong>5</strong> And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.  <strong>6</strong> Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.  <strong>7</strong> But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.  <strong>8</strong> And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.  <strong>9</strong> What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.  <strong>10</strong> And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:  <strong>11</strong> This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  <strong>12</strong> And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.  <strong>13</strong> And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.  <strong>14</strong> And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?  <strong>15</strong> Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may seeit.  <strong>16</strong> And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.  <strong>18</strong> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  <strong>19</strong> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  <strong>20</strong> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  <strong>21</strong> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.  <strong>22</strong> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  <strong>23</strong> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  <strong>24</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  <strong>25</strong> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.  <strong>26</strong> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am  the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  <strong>27</strong> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. <strong>28</strong> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:  <strong>30</strong> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  <strong>31</strong> And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.  <strong>32</strong> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  <strong>33</strong> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  <strong>34</strong> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?  <strong>36</strong> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  <strong>37</strong> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,  <strong>39</strong> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:  <strong>40</strong> Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. <strong>41</strong> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.  <strong>42</strong> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.  <strong>43</strong> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:  <strong>44</strong> For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> He then began to speak to them in parables: \"A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Haven't you read this scripture: \"'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They came to him and said, \"Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Should we pay or shouldn't we?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. \"Why are you trying to trap me?\" he asked. \"Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.\" They brought the coin, and he asked them, \"Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?Caesar's,\" they replied. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\" And they were amazed at him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, \"How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\" The large crowd listened to him with delight. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> As he taught, Jesus said, \"Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, \"I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on.\" "},{"_id":"616b950bede035c13f932cbd","topicId":"616b950bede035c13f932cbb","verse":"Mark 11:27-12:17","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p41011027_06-2\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41011027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And they came again to Jerusalem.

My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:  <strong>2</strong> And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.  <strong>3</strong> And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.  <strong>4</strong> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?  <strong>5</strong> And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:  <strong>6</strong> And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.  <strong>7</strong> For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.  <strong>8</strong> Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth!  <strong>9</strong> In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.  <strong>10</strong> Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.  <strong>11</strong> Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them!  <strong>12</strong> And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have  no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.  <strong>15</strong> And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:  <strong>16</strong> But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.  <strong>17</strong> Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.  <strong>18</strong> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope:  <strong>19</strong> That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it! <strong>20</strong> Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!  <strong>21</strong> Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!  <strong>22</strong> Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink:  <strong>23</strong> Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!  <strong>24</strong> Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is  stretched out still.  <strong>26</strong> And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:  <strong>27</strong> None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:  <strong>28</strong> Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind:  <strong>29</strong> Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.  <strong>30</strong> And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and  sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard: My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing: \"Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, a homer of seed only an ephah of grain.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> to those who say, \"Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come, so we may know it.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore the LORD's anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily! <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal thong is broken. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds. "}]}
