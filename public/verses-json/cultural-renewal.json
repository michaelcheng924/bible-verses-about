They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  <strong>4</strong> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  <strong>5</strong> Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat?

It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Come and have breakfast.\" None of the disciples dared ask him, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?Yes, Lord,\" he said, \"you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my lambs.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again Jesus said, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me?\" He answered, \"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Take care of my sheep.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The third time he said to him, \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" He said, \"Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Feed my sheep. I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, \"Follow me!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, \"Lord, who is going to betray you?\") <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Peter saw him, he asked, \"Lord, what about him?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.

Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  <strong>22</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "}]}
