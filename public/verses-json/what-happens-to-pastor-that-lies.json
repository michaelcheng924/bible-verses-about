Thus did Job continually.  <strong>6</strong> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.  <strong>7</strong> And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.  <strong>8</strong> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  <strong>9</strong> Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  <strong>10</strong> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.  <strong>11</strong> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.  <strong>12</strong> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is  in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were  eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:  <strong>14</strong> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:  <strong>15</strong> And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  <strong>16</strong> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  <strong>17</strong> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  <strong>18</strong> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house:  <strong>19</strong> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  <strong>20</strong> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,  <strong>21</strong> And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He had seven sons and three daughters, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, \"Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.\" This was Job's regular custom. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD said to Satan, \"Where have you come from?\" Satan answered the LORD, \"From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Satan, \"Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Does Job fear God for nothing?\" Satan replied. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The LORD said to Satan, \"Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.\" Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> a messenger came to Job and said, \"The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, \"The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, \"The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, \"Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and said: \"Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
