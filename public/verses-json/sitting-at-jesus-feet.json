 <strong>41</strong> But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.  <strong>42</strong> But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.  <strong>43</strong> Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.  <strong>44</strong> Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them. <strong>45</strong> Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.  <strong>46</strong> And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.  <strong>47</strong> Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.  <strong>48</strong> Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.  <strong>49</strong> Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:  <strong>50</strong> That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;  <strong>51</strong> From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.  <strong>52</strong> Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.  <strong>53</strong> And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:  <strong>54</strong> Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.

if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?

 <strong>34</strong> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  <strong>35</strong> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.

If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, \"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"The servant fell on his knees before him.

In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God.

For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.  <strong>45</strong> A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. <strong>46</strong>           And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?  <strong>47</strong> Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:  <strong>48</strong> He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.  <strong>49</strong> But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Some of the Pharisees asked, \"Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jesus answered them, \"Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, \"Get up and stand in front of everyone.\" So he got up and stood there. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He did so, and his hand was completely restored. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil spirits were cured, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Looking at his disciples, he said: \"Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Do to others as you would have them do to you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He also told them this parable: \"Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.\" "},{"_id":"616ad5539dfb4d9c011d8c3e","topicId":"616ad54b9dfb4d9c011d8c26","verse":"John 13:1-38","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43013001_06-25\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v43013001-1\">13:1&nbsp;</b>Now before the Feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43013002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>During supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43013003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43013004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>rose from supper.

Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.  <strong>9</strong> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my  hands and my head.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.  <strong>11</strong> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.  <strong>12</strong> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?  <strong>13</strong> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.  <strong>14</strong> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.  <strong>15</strong> For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.  <strong>16</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.  <strong>17</strong> If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them. <strong>18</strong>           I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.  <strong>19</strong> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.  <strong>20</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.  <strong>21</strong> When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  <strong>22</strong> Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.  <strong>23</strong> Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.  <strong>24</strong> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.  <strong>25</strong> He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it  to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.  <strong>27</strong> And after the sop Satan entered into him.

And he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And there was a division among them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, “He is a prophet.”</p>\n<p id=\"p43009017_07-26\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>(His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”</p>\n<p id=\"p43009023_07-26\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God.

Do you also want to become his disciples?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>And they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>The man answered, “Why, this is an amazing thing! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>They answered him, “You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they cast him out.</p>\n<p id=\"p43009034_07-26\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, <span class=\"woc\">“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>He answered, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to him, <span class=\"woc\">“You have seen him, and it is he who is speaking to you.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>Jesus said, <span class=\"woc\">“For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43009041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"woc\">“If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.</span></p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.  <strong>2</strong> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?  <strong>3</strong> Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.  <strong>4</strong> I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.  <strong>5</strong> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.  <strong>6</strong> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,  <strong>7</strong> And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.  <strong>8</strong> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  <strong>9</strong> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but  he said, I am he.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  <strong>11</strong> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash:  and I went and washed, and I received sight.  <strong>12</strong> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.  <strong>13</strong> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.  <strong>14</strong> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.  <strong>15</strong> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.  <strong>17</strong> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.  <strong>18</strong> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.  <strong>19</strong> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?  <strong>20</strong> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:  <strong>21</strong> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.  <strong>22</strong> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.  <strong>24</strong> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.  <strong>25</strong> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.  <strong>26</strong> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?  <strong>27</strong> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?  <strong>28</strong> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.  <strong>29</strong> We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow,  we know not from whence he is.  <strong>30</strong> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.  <strong>31</strong> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.  <strong>32</strong> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.  <strong>33</strong> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.  <strong>34</strong> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.  <strong>35</strong> Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  <strong>36</strong> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  <strong>37</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.  <strong>39</strong> And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.  <strong>40</strong> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  <strong>41</strong> Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> His disciples asked him, \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Neither this man nor his parents sinned,\" said Jesus, \"but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Go,\" he told him, \"wash in the Pool of Siloam\" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, \"Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Some claimed that he was. Others said, \"No, he only looks like him.\" But he himself insisted, \"I am the man.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"How then were your eyes opened?\" they demanded. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He replied, \"The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Where is this man?\" they asked him. \"I don't know,\" he said. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. \"He put mud on my eyes,\" the man replied, \"and I washed, and now I see.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.\" But others asked, \"How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?\" So they were divided. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Finally they turned again to the blind man, \"What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.\" The man replied, \"He is a prophet.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Is this your son?\" they asked. \"Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"We know he is our son,\" the parents answered, \"and we know he was born blind. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> That was why his parents said, \"He is of age; ask him.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. \"Give glory to God, \"they said. \"We know this man is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He replied, \"Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He answered, \"I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they hurled insults at him and said, \"You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The man answered, \"Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> To this they replied, \"You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!\" And they threw him out. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Who is he, sir?\" the man asked. \"Tell me so that I may believe in him.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the man said, \"Lord, I believe,\" and he worshiped him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \"What? Are we blind too?\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains. "}]}
