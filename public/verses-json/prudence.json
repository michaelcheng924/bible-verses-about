And to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say, 'No harm will come to you.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see or to hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand it clearly. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I did not send these prophets, yet they have run with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they have prophesied. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Am I only a God nearby,\" declares the LORD, \"and not a God far away? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see him?\" declares the LORD. \"Do not I fill heaven and earth?\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, 'I had a dream! I had a dream!' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their fathers forgot my name through Baal worship. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Is not my word like fire,\" declares the LORD, \"and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore,\" declares the LORD, \"I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Yes,\" declares the LORD, \"I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, 'The LORD declares.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,\" declares the LORD. \"They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, 'What is the oracle of the LORD?' say to them, 'What oracle? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' I will punish that man and his household. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> This is what each of you keeps on saying to his friend or relative: 'What is the LORD's answer?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But you must not mention 'the oracle of the LORD 'again, because every man's own word becomes his oracle and so you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> This is what you keep saying to a prophet: 'What is the LORD's answer to you?' or 'What has the LORD spoken?' <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Although you claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' this is what the LORD says: You used the words, 'This is the oracle of the LORD,' even though I told you that you must not claim, 'This is the oracle of the LORD.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your fathers. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> I will bring upon you everlasting disgrace-everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.\" "},{"_id":"616a1135bda5ba8d73708e3d","topicId":"616a1131bda5ba8d73708e2e","verse":"Proverbs 1:1-7","votes":6,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p20001001_05-17\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v20001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</p>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p20001002_05-17\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v20001002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;To know wisdom and instruction,</span><br><span id=\"p20001002_05-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to understand words of insight,</span><br><span id=\"p20001003_05-17\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v20001003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;to receive instruction in wise dealing,</span><br><span id=\"p20001003_05-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in righteousness, justice, and equity;</span><br><span id=\"p20001004_05-17\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v20001004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;to give prudence to the simple,</span><br><span id=\"p20001004_05-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge and discretion to the youth—</span><br><span id=\"p20001005_05-17\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v20001005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the wise hear and increase in learning,</span><br><span id=\"p20001005_05-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the one who understands obtain guidance,</span><br><span id=\"p20001006_05-17\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v20001006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;to understand a proverb and a saying,</span><br><span id=\"p20001006_05-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the words of the wise and their riddles.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p20001007_05-17\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v20001007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge;</span><br><span id=\"p20001007_05-17\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fools despise wisdom and instruction.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;  <strong>2</strong> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;  <strong>3</strong> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;  <strong>4</strong> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.  <strong>5</strong> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:  <strong>6</strong> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.  <strong>7</strong> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but  fools despise wisdom and instruction.
