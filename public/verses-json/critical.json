Fare ye well.  <strong>30</strong> So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:  <strong>31</strong> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.  <strong>32</strong> And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.  <strong>33</strong> And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.  <strong>34</strong> Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.  <strong>35</strong> Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.  <strong>36</strong> And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.  <strong>37</strong> And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.  <strong>38</strong> But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.  <strong>39</strong> And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;  <strong>40</strong> And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.  <strong>41</strong> And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers: \"Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, \"The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The apostles and elders met to consider this question. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: \"Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When they finished, James spoke up: \"Brothers, listen to me. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Simon has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written: <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"'After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> that have been known for ages. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul-- <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, \"Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.

Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>But they said, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door.</p>\n<p id=\"p01019011_04-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the LORD, and the LORD has sent us to destroy it.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, “Up! Get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.</p>\n<p id=\"p01019014_04-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the LORD being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>And as they brought them out, one said, “Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>And Lot said to them, “Oh, no, my lords. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p01019022_07-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the LORD out of heaven. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>But Lot’s wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.</p>\n<p id=\"p01019026_07-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace.</p>\n<p id=\"p01019028_07-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p01019029_11-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose.</p>\n<p id=\"p01019033_11-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01019038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;  <strong>2</strong> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.  <strong>3</strong> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.  <strong>4</strong> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:  <strong>5</strong> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.  <strong>6</strong> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,  <strong>7</strong> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.  <strong>8</strong> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.  <strong>9</strong> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  <strong>10</strong> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  <strong>11</strong> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  <strong>12</strong> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:  <strong>13</strong> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.  <strong>14</strong> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.  <strong>15</strong> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  <strong>16</strong> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  <strong>18</strong> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:  <strong>19</strong> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:  <strong>20</strong> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.  <strong>21</strong> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.  <strong>22</strong> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  <strong>23</strong> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.  <strong>24</strong> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;  <strong>25</strong> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  <strong>28</strong> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  <strong>30</strong> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.  <strong>31</strong> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:  <strong>32</strong> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>33</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>34</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>35</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>36</strong> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.  <strong>37</strong> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.  <strong>38</strong> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"My lords,\" he said, \"please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning.No,\" they answered, \"we will spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-both young and old-surrounded the house. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They called to Lot, \"Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and said, \"No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Get out of our way,\" they replied. And they said, \"This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them.\" They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The two men said to Lot, \"Do you have anyone else here-sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, \"Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!\" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, \"Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Lot said to them, \"No, my lords, please! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it-it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to him, \"Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it.\" (That is why the town was called Zoar. ) <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah-from the LORD out of the heavens. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities-and also the vegetation in the land. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> One day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \"Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
