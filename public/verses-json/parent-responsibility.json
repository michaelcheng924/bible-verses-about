And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.  <strong>12</strong> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;  <strong>14</strong> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.  <strong>15</strong> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.  <strong>16</strong> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me  now: and if not, I will take it by force.  <strong>17</strong> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.  <strong>19</strong> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it  to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <strong>20</strong> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.  <strong>21</strong> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  <strong>23</strong> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.  <strong>24</strong> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.  <strong>25</strong> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.  <strong>26</strong> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.  <strong>27</strong> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?  <strong>28</strong> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be  my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?  <strong>29</strong> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that  thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.  <strong>31</strong> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.  <strong>32</strong> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.  <strong>33</strong> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.  <strong>34</strong> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.  <strong>35</strong> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.  <strong>36</strong> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Hannah prayed and said: \"My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn is lifted high.

This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \"Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the man said to him, \"Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want,\" the servant would then answer, \"No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they were treating the LORD's offering with contempt. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Samuel was ministering before the LORD -a boy wearing a linen ephod. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, \"May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD.\" Then they would go home. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So he said to them, \"Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?\" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, \"This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> and you will see distress in my dwelling.

I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, \"Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.\"'\" "},{"_id":"6168f08a803fbb813a70a691","topicId":"6168f084803fbb813a70a67b","verse":"Deuteronomy 6:4-9","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p05006004_01-24\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05006004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05006005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05006006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05006007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05006008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v05006009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>4</strong> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:  <strong>5</strong> And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.  <strong>6</strong> And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:  <strong>7</strong> And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.  <strong>8</strong> And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.  <strong>9</strong> And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
