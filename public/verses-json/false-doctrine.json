This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.
