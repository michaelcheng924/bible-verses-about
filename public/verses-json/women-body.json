 <strong>21</strong> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.  <strong>22</strong> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.  <strong>23</strong> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.  <strong>1</strong> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,  <strong>2</strong> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.  <strong>3</strong> Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.  <strong>4</strong> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.  <strong>5</strong> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.  <strong>6</strong> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:  <strong>7</strong> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  <strong>8</strong> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.  <strong>9</strong> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?  <strong>10</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>11</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.  <strong>12</strong> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.  <strong>13</strong> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;  <strong>14</strong> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.  <strong>16</strong> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are  an abomination unto him:  <strong>17</strong> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,  <strong>18</strong> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,  <strong>19</strong> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.  <strong>20</strong> My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:  <strong>21</strong> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.  <strong>22</strong> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.  <strong>23</strong> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:  <strong>24</strong> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  <strong>25</strong> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.  <strong>26</strong> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.  <strong>27</strong> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?  <strong>28</strong> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  <strong>29</strong> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.  <strong>30</strong> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;  <strong>31</strong> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.  <strong>32</strong> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.  <strong>33</strong> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.  <strong>34</strong> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  <strong>35</strong> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.  <strong>1</strong> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.  <strong>2</strong> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.  <strong>3</strong> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.  <strong>4</strong> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:  <strong>5</strong> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.  <strong>6</strong> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,  <strong>7</strong> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,  <strong>8</strong> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,  <strong>9</strong> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:  <strong>10</strong> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.  <strong>11</strong> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:  <strong>12</strong> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)  <strong>13</strong> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,  <strong>14</strong> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  <strong>16</strong> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,  with fine linen of Egypt.  <strong>17</strong> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  <strong>18</strong> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.  <strong>19</strong> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:  <strong>20</strong> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.  <strong>21</strong> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.  <strong>22</strong> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;  <strong>23</strong> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.  <strong>24</strong> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.  <strong>25</strong> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.  <strong>26</strong> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men  have been slain by her.  <strong>27</strong> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.
