","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \"Why do you look for the living among the dead? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then they remembered his words. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but they were kept from recognizing him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He asked them, \"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \"Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"What things?\" he asked. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and he took it and ate it in their presence. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He said to them, \"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He told them, \"This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> You are witnesses of these things. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
