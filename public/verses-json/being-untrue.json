And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!  <strong>6</strong> When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.  <strong>7</strong> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.  <strong>8</strong> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;  <strong>9</strong> And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.  <strong>10</strong> Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?  <strong>11</strong> Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.  <strong>12</strong> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.  <strong>13</strong> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.  <strong>14</strong> And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!  <strong>15</strong> But they cried out, Away with him, away with him,  crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.  <strong>16</strong> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.  <strong>17</strong> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place  of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:  <strong>18</strong> Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.  <strong>19</strong> And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>20</strong> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and  Greek, and Latin.  <strong>21</strong> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.  <strong>22</strong> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.  <strong>23</strong> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.  <strong>24</strong> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.  <strong>25</strong> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.  <strong>26</strong> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!  <strong>27</strong> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.  <strong>28</strong> After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.  <strong>29</strong> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.  <strong>30</strong> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.  <strong>31</strong> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that  they might be taken away.  <strong>32</strong> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.  <strong>33</strong> But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:  <strong>34</strong> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.  <strong>35</strong> And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.  <strong>36</strong> For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.  <strong>37</strong> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.  <strong>38</strong> And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.  <strong>39</strong> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.  <strong>40</strong> Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.  <strong>41</strong> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.  <strong>42</strong> There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and went up to him again and again, saying, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" And they struck him in the face. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, \"Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, \"Here is the man!\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, \"Crucify! Crucify!\" But Pilate answered, \"You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The Jews insisted, \"We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> and he went back inside the palace. \"Where do you come from?\" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Do you refuse to speak to me?\" Pilate said. \"Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, \"If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. \"Here is your king,\" Pilate said to the Jews. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But they shouted, \"Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!Shall I crucify your king?\" Pilate asked. \"We have no king but Caesar,\" the chief priests answered. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read:|sc JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, \"Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Pilate answered, \"What I have written, I have written.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Let's not tear it,\" they said to one another. \"Let's decide by lot who will get it.\" This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, \"They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.\" So this is what the soldiers did. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \"Dear woman, here is your son,\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and to the disciple, \"Here is your mother.\" From that time on, this disciple took her into his home. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, \"I am thirsty.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When he had received the drink, Jesus said, \"It is finished.\" With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: \"Not one of his bones will be broken,\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and, as another scripture says, \"They will look on the one they have pierced.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.

He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.  <strong>24</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.  <strong>25</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.  <strong>26</strong> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;  <strong>27</strong> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.  <strong>28</strong> Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,  <strong>29</strong> And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.  <strong>30</strong> I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.  <strong>31</strong> If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. <strong>32</strong>           There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.  <strong>33</strong> Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.  <strong>34</strong> But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.  <strong>35</strong> He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. <strong>36</strong>           But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.  <strong>37</strong> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.  <strong>38</strong> And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. <strong>39</strong>           Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.  <strong>40</strong> And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.  <strong>41</strong> I receive not honour from men.  <strong>42</strong> But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.  <strong>43</strong> I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.  <strong>44</strong> How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?  <strong>45</strong> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.  <strong>46</strong> For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.  <strong>47</strong> But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, \"Do you want to get well?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the invalid replied, \"I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to him, \"Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, \"It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But he replied, \"The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, \"See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus gave them this answer: \"I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life.

When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground- <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground-trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And the LORD God commanded the man, \"You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The LORD God said, \"It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The man said, \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman, 'for she was taken out of man.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
