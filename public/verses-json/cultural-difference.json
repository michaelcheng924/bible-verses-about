He who loves his wife loves himself. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> for we are members of his body. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.  <strong>19</strong> And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  <strong>20</strong> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.  <strong>21</strong> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)  <strong>22</strong> Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye  men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.  <strong>23</strong> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.  <strong>24</strong> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  <strong>25</strong> Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  <strong>26</strong> And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;  <strong>27</strong> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  <strong>28</strong> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.  <strong>29</strong> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.  <strong>30</strong> And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:  <strong>31</strong> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof  he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.  <strong>32</strong> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.  <strong>33</strong> So Paul departed from among them.  <strong>34</strong> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. \"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ, \"he said. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: \"These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, \"What is this babbler trying to say?\" Others remarked, \"He seems to be advocating foreign gods.\" They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, \"May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \"Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:|sc TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> 'For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man's design and skill. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, \"We want to hear you again on this subject.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At that, Paul left the Council. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.

They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!\"? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
