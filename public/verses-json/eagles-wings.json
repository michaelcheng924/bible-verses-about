So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  <strong>17</strong> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.  <strong>19</strong> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;  <strong>20</strong> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of  the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of  that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.  <strong>21</strong> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <strong>22</strong> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.  <strong>23</strong> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <strong>24</strong> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  <strong>25</strong> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.  <strong>26</strong> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  <strong>27</strong> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.  <strong>28</strong> Hitherto is the end of the matter.

He wrote down the substance of his dream. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter.

Have you not understood since the earth was founded? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers.

Or who is my equal?\" says the Holy One. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name.

And he said unto them,  <strong>24</strong>           Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.  <strong>25</strong> When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:  <strong>26</strong> Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.  <strong>27</strong> But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.  <strong>28</strong> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.  <strong>29</strong> And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.  <strong>30</strong> And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last. <strong>31</strong> The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.  <strong>32</strong> And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day  I shall be perfected.  <strong>33</strong> Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day  following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.  <strong>34</strong> O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her  wings, and ye would not!  <strong>35</strong> Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then he told this parable: \"A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, \"Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, \"There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The Lord answered him, \"You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water? <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then Jesus asked, \"What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Again he asked, \"What shall I compare the kingdom of God to? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Someone asked him, \"Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.'\"But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, \"Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He replied, \"Go tell that fox, 'I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In any case, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day--for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem! <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Look, your house is left to you desolate.
