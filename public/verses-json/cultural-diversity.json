May I ask why you sent for me?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cornelius answered: \"Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.  <strong>5</strong> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.  <strong>6</strong> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.  He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.  <strong>7</strong> For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  <strong>8</strong> For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.  <strong>9</strong> For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.  <strong>10</strong> But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  <strong>11</strong> For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  <strong>12</strong> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.  <strong>13</strong> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his  brother’s way.  <strong>14</strong> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is  nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.  <strong>15</strong> But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  <strong>16</strong> Let not then your good be evil spoken of:  <strong>17</strong> For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  <strong>18</strong> For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.  <strong>19</strong> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  <strong>20</strong> For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are  pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.  <strong>21</strong> It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  <strong>22</strong> Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  <strong>23</strong> And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth  not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It is written: \"'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.

God forbid.  <strong>18</strong> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.  <strong>19</strong> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.  <strong>20</strong> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  <strong>21</strong> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come  by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.  <strong>1</strong> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?  <strong>2</strong> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  <strong>3</strong> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?  <strong>4</strong> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.  <strong>5</strong> He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  <strong>6</strong> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  <strong>7</strong> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.  <strong>8</strong> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.  <strong>9</strong> So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.  <strong>10</strong> For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.  <strong>11</strong> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is  evident: for, The just shall live by faith.  <strong>12</strong> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.  <strong>13</strong> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:  <strong>14</strong> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.  <strong>15</strong> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.  <strong>16</strong> Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.  <strong>17</strong> And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.  <strong>18</strong> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.  <strong>19</strong> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.  <strong>20</strong> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.  <strong>21</strong> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.  <strong>22</strong> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.  <strong>23</strong> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  <strong>24</strong> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <strong>25</strong> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.  <strong>26</strong> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  <strong>27</strong> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  <strong>28</strong> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  <strong>29</strong> And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
