Go!” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>But she said to him, “No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other that you did to me.” But he would not listen to her. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>He called the young man who served him and said, “Put this woman out of my presence and bolt the door after her.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves, for thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed. So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>And Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she wore.

Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>But Absalom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Then Absalom commanded his servants, “Mark when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Do not fear; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v10013029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded.

And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.  <strong>5</strong> And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.  <strong>6</strong> So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.  <strong>7</strong> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.  <strong>8</strong> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.  <strong>9</strong> And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.  <strong>10</strong> And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.  <strong>11</strong> And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.  <strong>12</strong> And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.  <strong>13</strong> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.  <strong>14</strong> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.  <strong>15</strong> Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.  <strong>16</strong> And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.  <strong>17</strong> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.  <strong>18</strong> And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.  <strong>19</strong> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.  <strong>20</strong> And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.  <strong>21</strong> But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.  <strong>22</strong> And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.  <strong>24</strong> And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.  <strong>25</strong> And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.  <strong>26</strong> Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?  <strong>27</strong> But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.  <strong>28</strong> Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous and be valiant.  <strong>29</strong> And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.  <strong>31</strong> Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.  <strong>32</strong> And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.  <strong>33</strong> Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.  <strong>34</strong> But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.  <strong>35</strong> And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.  <strong>37</strong> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.  <strong>38</strong> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.  <strong>39</strong> And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He asked Amnon, \"Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?\" Amnon said to him, \"I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Go to bed and pretend to be ill,\" Jonadab said. \"When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, \"I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> David sent word to Tamar at the palace: \"Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. \"Send everyone out of here,\" Amnon said. So everyone left him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Amnon said to Tamar, \"Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.\" And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, \"Come to bed with me, my sister.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Don't, my brother!\" she said to him. \"Don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, \"Get up and get out!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No!\" she said to him. \"Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.\" But he refused to listen to her. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He called his personal servant and said, \"Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Her brother Absalom said to her, \"Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart.\" And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When King David heard all this, he was furious. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Absalom went to the king and said, \"Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"No, my son,\" the king replied. \"All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.\" Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Absalom said, \"If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.\" The king asked him, \"Why should he go with you?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Absalom ordered his men, \"Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> While they were on their way, the report came to David: \"Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, \"My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, \"I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jonadab said to the king, \"See, the king's sons are here; it has happened just as your servant said.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned for his son every day. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And the spirit of the king longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.

And he knew her again no more.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.  <strong>28</strong> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first,  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.  <strong>30</strong> And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to death. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Judah said to Onan, \"Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> What he did was wicked in the LORD's sight; so he put him to death also. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, \"Live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up.\" For he thought, \"He may die too, just like his brothers.\" So Tamar went to live in her father's house. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Tamar was told, \"Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, \"Come now, let me sleep with you.And what will you give me to sleep with you?\" she asked. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I'll send you a young goat from my flock,\" he said. \"Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?\" she asked. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He said, \"What pledge should I give you?Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,\" she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He asked the men who lived there, \"Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here,\" they said. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So he went back to Judah and said, \"I didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, 'There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.'\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Judah said, \"Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> About three months later Judah was told, \"Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant.\" Judah said, \"Bring her out and have her burned to death!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. \"I am pregnant by the man who owns these,\" she said. And she added, \"See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Judah recognized them and said, \"She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah.\" And he did not sleep with her again. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, \"This one came out first.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, \"So this is how you have broken out!\" And he was named Perez. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out and he was given the name Zerah.

But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

But to those who do not believe, \"The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, \" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and, \"A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.\" They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.

And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  <strong>24</strong> And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.  <strong>25</strong> And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.  <strong>26</strong> But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.  <strong>27</strong> And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.  <strong>28</strong> And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.  <strong>29</strong> Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?  <strong>30</strong> And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,  <strong>31</strong> And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.  <strong>32</strong> Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.  <strong>33</strong> Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  <strong>34</strong> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  <strong>35</strong> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  <strong>36</strong> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  <strong>37</strong> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <strong>38</strong> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  <strong>39</strong> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  <strong>40</strong> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  <strong>41</strong> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  <strong>42</strong> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  <strong>43</strong> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  <strong>44</strong> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  <strong>45</strong> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>46</strong> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  <strong>47</strong> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  <strong>48</strong> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.

He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, \"Cornelius!\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Cornelius stared at him in fear. \"What is it, Lord?\" he asked. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then a voice told him, \"Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Surely not, Lord!\" Peter replied. \"I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The voice spoke to him a second time, \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, \"Simon, three men are looking for you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Peter went down and said to the men, \"I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men replied, \"We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Peter made him get up. \"Stand up,\" he said, \"I am only a man myself.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to them: \"You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cornelius answered: \"Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.

Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  <strong>22</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "},{"_id":"616b38d4ede035c13f9322f6","topicId":"616b38ceede035c13f9322e2","verse":"Matthew 25:1-46","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p40025001_07-24\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v40025001-1\">25:1&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40025002-1\">2&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40025003-1\">3&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them,</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40025004-1\">4&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40025005-1\">5&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40025006-1\">6&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom!

Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and said, \"Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus-- <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> he was one of our number and shared in this ministry.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"For,\" said Peter, \"it is written in the book of Psalms, \"'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, \"'May another take his place of leadership.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then they prayed, \"Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.

This is he which received seed by the way side.  <strong>20</strong> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  <strong>21</strong> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.  <strong>22</strong> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  <strong>23</strong> But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. <strong>24</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:  <strong>25</strong> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.  <strong>26</strong> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.  <strong>27</strong> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  <strong>28</strong> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  <strong>29</strong> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.  <strong>30</strong> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. <strong>31</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:  <strong>32</strong> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <strong>33</strong> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  <strong>34</strong> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  <strong>35</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  <strong>36</strong> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;  <strong>38</strong> The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;  <strong>39</strong> The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  <strong>40</strong> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.  <strong>41</strong> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;  <strong>42</strong> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>43</strong> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <strong>44</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. <strong>45</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:  <strong>46</strong> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. <strong>47</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:  <strong>48</strong> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.  <strong>49</strong> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  <strong>50</strong> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>51</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?  They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  <strong>52</strong> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is  instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. <strong>53</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.  <strong>54</strong> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  <strong>55</strong> Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  <strong>56</strong> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?  <strong>57</strong> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.  <strong>58</strong> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then he told them many things in parables, saying: \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He who has ears, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The disciples came to him and asked, \"Why do you speak to the people in parables?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He replied, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is why I speak to them in parables: \"Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: \"'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"'An enemy did this,' he replied. \"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"Have you understood all these things?\" Jesus asked. \"Yes,\" they replied. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\" they asked. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> \"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
