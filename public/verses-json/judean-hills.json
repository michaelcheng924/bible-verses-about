<strong>105</strong> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  <strong>106</strong> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  <strong>107</strong> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>108</strong> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  <strong>109</strong> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.  <strong>110</strong> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.

false way.  <strong>129</strong> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.  <strong>130</strong> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.  <strong>131</strong> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.  <strong>132</strong> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  <strong>133</strong> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  <strong>134</strong> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.  <strong>135</strong> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>136</strong> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  <strong>137</strong> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.  <strong>138</strong> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  <strong>139</strong> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  <strong>140</strong> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.  <strong>141</strong> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.  <strong>142</strong> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.  <strong>143</strong> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.  <strong>144</strong> The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.  <strong>145</strong> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.  <strong>146</strong> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  <strong>147</strong> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.  <strong>148</strong> Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  <strong>149</strong> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  <strong>150</strong> They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.  <strong>151</strong> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are  truth.

Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.  <strong>157</strong> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet  do I not decline from thy testimonies.

lovingkindness.  <strong>160</strong> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  <strong>161</strong> Princes have persecuted me without a cause:

 <strong>10</strong> Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.  <strong>11</strong> I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.  <strong>12</strong> Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.  <strong>13</strong> Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.  <strong>14</strong> And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.  <strong>15</strong> Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.  <strong>16</strong> Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?  <strong>17</strong> They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.  <strong>18</strong> But it is good to be zealously affected always in a  good thing, and not only when I am present with you.  <strong>19</strong> My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,  <strong>20</strong> I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.  <strong>21</strong> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?  <strong>22</strong> For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.  <strong>23</strong> But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.  <strong>24</strong> Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.  <strong>25</strong> For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.  <strong>26</strong> But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.  <strong>27</strong> For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.  <strong>28</strong> Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.  <strong>29</strong> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.  <strong>30</strong> Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.  <strong>31</strong> So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.

One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For it is written: \"Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But what does the Scripture say? \"Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.

The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and he began by saying to them, \"Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. \"Isn't this Joseph's son?\" they asked. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" he continued, \"no prophet is accepted in his hometown. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed--only Naaman the Syrian.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
