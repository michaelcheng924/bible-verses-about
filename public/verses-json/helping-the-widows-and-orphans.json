A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  <strong>15</strong> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  <strong>16</strong> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <strong>17</strong>           Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  <strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <strong>21</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  <strong>24</strong> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <strong>25</strong> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  <strong>26</strong> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <strong>27</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  <strong>28</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  <strong>29</strong> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>30</strong> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>31</strong> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  <strong>32</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <strong>33</strong>           Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  <strong>34</strong> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  <strong>35</strong> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  <strong>36</strong> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  <strong>37</strong> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <strong>38</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  <strong>39</strong> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  <strong>40</strong> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.  <strong>41</strong> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  <strong>42</strong> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <strong>43</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  <strong>44</strong> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  <strong>45</strong> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  <strong>46</strong> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  <strong>47</strong> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  <strong>48</strong> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and he began to teach them saying: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca, 'is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
