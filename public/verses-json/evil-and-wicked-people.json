my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.  <strong>3</strong> For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  <strong>4</strong> For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.  <strong>5</strong> They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.  <strong>6</strong> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.  <strong>7</strong> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.  <strong>8</strong> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.  <strong>9</strong> They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup  are wrung out to them.  <strong>11</strong> And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?  <strong>12</strong> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.  <strong>13</strong> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.  <strong>14</strong> For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.  <strong>15</strong> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against  the generation of thy children.  <strong>16</strong> When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;  <strong>17</strong> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.  <strong>18</strong> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.  <strong>19</strong> How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.  <strong>20</strong> As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.  <strong>21</strong> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.  <strong>22</strong> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.  <strong>23</strong> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.  <strong>24</strong> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.  <strong>25</strong> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.  <strong>26</strong> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.  <strong>27</strong> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.  <strong>28</strong> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> A psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> From their callous hearts comes iniquity; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They say, \"How can God know?
