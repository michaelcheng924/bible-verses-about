And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "},{"_id":"616a3470a03c6e96020b9c0d","topicId":"616a346ca03c6e96020b9c01","verse":"John 1:1","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43001001_05-15\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v43001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

for wisdom and honour.  <strong>2</strong> A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.  <strong>3</strong> Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.  <strong>4</strong> If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.  <strong>5</strong> There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:  <strong>6</strong> Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.  <strong>7</strong> I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.  <strong>8</strong> He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.  <strong>9</strong> Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.  <strong>10</strong> If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.  <strong>11</strong> Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.  <strong>12</strong> The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.  <strong>13</strong> The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.  <strong>14</strong> A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?  <strong>15</strong> The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.  <strong>16</strong> Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!  <strong>17</strong> Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!  <strong>18</strong> By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.  <strong>19</strong> A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things. <strong>20</strong> Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Even as he walks along the road, the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed but skill will bring success. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If a snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> At the beginning his words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness- <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming- who can tell him what will happen after him? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> A fool's work wearies him; he does not know the way to town. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time- for strength and not for drunkenness. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his hands are idle, the house leaks. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.
