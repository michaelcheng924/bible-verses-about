What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.  <strong>7</strong> They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?  <strong>8</strong> He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.  <strong>9</strong> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  <strong>10</strong> His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.  <strong>11</strong> But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.  <strong>12</strong> For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their  mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. <strong>13</strong> Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.  <strong>14</strong> But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>15</strong> And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.  <strong>16</strong> And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?  <strong>17</strong> And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is  none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.  <strong>18</strong> He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,  <strong>19</strong> Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <strong>20</strong> The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?  <strong>21</strong> Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and  sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.  <strong>22</strong> But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.  <strong>23</strong> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>24</strong> And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>25</strong> When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?  <strong>26</strong> But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. <strong>27</strong> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?  <strong>28</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  <strong>29</strong> And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.  <strong>30</strong> But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.

They asked, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"Haven't you read,\" he replied, \"that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,' <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Why then,\" they asked, \"did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The disciples said to him, \"If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them.

Then come, follow me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, \"Who then can be saved?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Peter answered him, \"We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
