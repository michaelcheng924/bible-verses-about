and understanding put forth her voice?  <strong>2</strong> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  <strong>3</strong> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  <strong>4</strong> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.  <strong>5</strong> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  <strong>6</strong> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.  <strong>7</strong> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  <strong>8</strong> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is  nothing froward or perverse in them.  <strong>9</strong> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  <strong>10</strong> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  <strong>11</strong> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  <strong>12</strong> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  <strong>13</strong> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  <strong>14</strong> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.  <strong>15</strong> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  <strong>16</strong> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.  <strong>17</strong> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.  <strong>18</strong> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  <strong>19</strong> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.  <strong>20</strong> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:  <strong>21</strong> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  <strong>22</strong> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  <strong>23</strong> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  <strong>24</strong> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.  <strong>25</strong> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:  <strong>26</strong> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  <strong>27</strong> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  <strong>28</strong> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:  <strong>29</strong> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:  <strong>30</strong> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:  and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;  <strong>31</strong> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.  <strong>32</strong> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.  <strong>33</strong> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.  <strong>34</strong> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.  <strong>35</strong> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.  <strong>36</strong> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
