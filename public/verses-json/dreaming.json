In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"615fbb3ca7e6c939a16fada2","topicId":"615fbb37a7e6c939a16fad99","verse":"Luke 2:1-52","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p

He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For my eyes have seen your salvation, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> which you have prepared in the sight of all people, <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: \"This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, \"Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"Why were you searching for me?\" he asked. \"Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But they did not understand what he was saying to them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.

 <strong>2</strong> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.  <strong>3</strong> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <strong>4</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <strong>6</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <strong>7</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.  <strong>8</strong> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.  <strong>10</strong> So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.  <strong>11</strong> Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:  <strong>12</strong> And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.  <strong>13</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art  thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.  <strong>14</strong> And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?  <strong>15</strong> And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and  fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.  <strong>16</strong> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.  <strong>17</strong> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  <strong>18</strong> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of  the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  <strong>19</strong> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <strong>20</strong> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <strong>21</strong> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.  <strong>22</strong> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  <strong>23</strong> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.  <strong>24</strong> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  <strong>25</strong> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  <strong>26</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <strong>27</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Where have you come from?\" David asked him. He answered, \"I have escaped from the Israelite camp.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"What happened?\" David asked. \"Tell me.\" He said, \"The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, \"How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,\" the young man said, \"and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, 'What can I do?' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"He asked me, 'Who are you?'\"'An Amalekite,' I answered. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then he said to me, 'Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> David said to the young man who brought him the report, \"Where are you from?I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite,\" he answered. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David asked him, \"Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then David called one of his men and said, \"Go, strike him down!\" So he struck him down, and he died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For David had said to him, \"Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD's anointed.'\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen!

Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he has been a man of war from his youth.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09017034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>But David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep sheep for his father.

am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.  <strong>9</strong> If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.  <strong>10</strong> And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.  <strong>11</strong> When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.  <strong>12</strong> Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.  <strong>13</strong> And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the first born, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.  <strong>14</strong> And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.  <strong>15</strong> But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.  <strong>16</strong> And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;  <strong>18</strong> And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.  <strong>19</strong> Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.  <strong>20</strong> And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.  <strong>21</strong> For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.  <strong>22</strong> And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.  <strong>23</strong> And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard them.  <strong>24</strong> And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.  <strong>25</strong> And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.  <strong>26</strong> And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?  <strong>27</strong> And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.  <strong>28</strong> And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.  <strong>29</strong> And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?  <strong>30</strong> And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.  <strong>31</strong> And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.  <strong>32</strong> And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.  <strong>33</strong> And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.  <strong>34</strong> And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:  <strong>35</strong> And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it  out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him  by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.  <strong>36</strong> Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.  <strong>37</strong> David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.  <strong>38</strong> And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.  <strong>39</strong> And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.  <strong>40</strong> And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.  <strong>41</strong> And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him.  <strong>42</strong> And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.  <strong>43</strong> And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.  <strong>44</strong> And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.  <strong>45</strong> Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.  <strong>46</strong> This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.  <strong>47</strong> And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’S, and he will give you into our hands.  <strong>48</strong> And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.  <strong>49</strong> And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.  <strong>50</strong> So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.  <strong>51</strong> Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.  <strong>52</strong> And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.  <strong>53</strong> And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.  <strong>54</strong> And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.  <strong>55</strong> And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.  <strong>56</strong> And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.  <strong>57</strong> And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.  <strong>58</strong> And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou  young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, \"Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the Philistine said, \"This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war: The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now Jesse said to his son David, \"Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now the Israelites had been saying, \"Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> David asked the men standing near him, \"What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, \"This is what will be done for the man who kills him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, \"Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Now what have I done?\" said David. \"Can't I even speak?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> David said to Saul, \"Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.\" Saul said to David, \"Go, and the LORD be with you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. \"I cannot go in these,\" he said to Saul, \"because I am not used to them.\" So he took them off. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He said to David, \"Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?\" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Come here,\" he said, \"and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> David said to the Philistine, \"You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, \"Abner, whose son is that young man?\" Abner replied, \"As surely as you live, O king, I don't know.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The king said, \"Find out whose son this young man is.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"Whose son are you, young man?\" Saul asked him. David said, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.\" "},{"_id":"615fbb3da7e6c939a16fadaf","topicId":"615fbb37a7e6c939a16fad99","verse":"1 Samuel 1:1-28","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p09001001_05-27\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v09001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09001002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>He had two wives.

Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.  <strong>11</strong> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.  <strong>12</strong> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.  <strong>13</strong> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.  <strong>14</strong> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.  <strong>15</strong> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunken neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.  <strong>17</strong> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.  <strong>18</strong> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.  <strong>19</strong> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying,  Because I have asked him of the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.  <strong>22</strong> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.  <strong>23</strong> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.  <strong>24</strong> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.  <strong>25</strong> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.  <strong>26</strong> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:  <strong>28</strong> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Elkanah her husband would say to her, \"Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And she made a vow, saying, \"O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and said to her, \"How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Not so, my lord,\" Hannah replied, \"I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Eli answered, \"Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She said, \"May your servant find favor in your eyes.\" Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, \"Because I asked the LORD for him.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, \"After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Do what seems best to you,\" Elkanah her husband told her. \"Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word.\" So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and she said to him, \"As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD.\" And he worshiped the LORD there.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Nephilim were on the earth in those days-and also afterward-when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So the LORD said, \"I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth-men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air-for I am grieved that I have made them.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So God said to Noah, \"I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark-you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
