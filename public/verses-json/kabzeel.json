David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,  <strong>2</strong> The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.  <strong>3</strong> The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.  <strong>4</strong> And he shall be as the light of the morning, when  the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as  the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.  <strong>5</strong> Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.  <strong>6</strong> But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:  <strong>7</strong> But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.  <strong>8</strong> These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.  <strong>9</strong> And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:  <strong>10</strong> He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.  <strong>11</strong> And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.  <strong>12</strong> But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.  <strong>13</strong> And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.  <strong>14</strong> And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.  <strong>15</strong> And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!  <strong>16</strong> And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.  <strong>18</strong> And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three.

As one of the three mighty men, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel's troops fled from them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> During harvest time, three of the thirty chief men came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> David longed for water and said, \"Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!\" he said. \"Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?\" And David would not drink it.

He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three.

fortress, and my deliverer;  <strong>3</strong> The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.  <strong>4</strong> I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  <strong>5</strong> When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;  <strong>6</strong> The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;  <strong>7</strong> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.  <strong>8</strong> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.  <strong>9</strong> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  <strong>10</strong> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was  under his feet.  <strong>11</strong> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.  <strong>12</strong> And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and  thick clouds of the skies.  <strong>13</strong> Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.  <strong>15</strong> And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.  <strong>16</strong> And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.  <strong>17</strong> He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;  <strong>18</strong> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.  <strong>19</strong> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  <strong>20</strong> He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  <strong>22</strong> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  <strong>23</strong> For all his judgments were before me: and as for  his statutes, I did not depart from them.  <strong>24</strong> I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.  <strong>26</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.  <strong>27</strong> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.  <strong>28</strong> And the

<strong>30</strong> For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.  <strong>31</strong> As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.  <strong>32</strong> For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?  <strong>33</strong> God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.  <strong>34</strong> He maketh my feet like hinds feet: and setteth me upon my high places.  <strong>35</strong> He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  <strong>36</strong> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.  <strong>37</strong> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.  <strong>38</strong> I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.  <strong>39</strong> And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.  <strong>40</strong> For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.  <strong>41</strong> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.  <strong>42</strong> They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  <strong>43</strong> Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.  <strong>44</strong> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.  <strong>45</strong> Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.  <strong>47</strong> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.  <strong>48</strong> It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,  <strong>49</strong> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  <strong>50</strong> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.  <strong>51</strong> He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.  <strong>5</strong> And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:  <strong>6</strong> Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi; and they came to Dan-jaan, and about to Zidon,  <strong>7</strong> And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beer-sheba.  <strong>8</strong> So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.  <strong>9</strong> And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.  <strong>10</strong> And David’s heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.  <strong>11</strong> For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,  <strong>12</strong> Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.  <strong>13</strong> So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.  <strong>14</strong> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.  <strong>15</strong> So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.  <strong>16</strong> And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.  <strong>17</strong> And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.  <strong>18</strong> And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.  <strong>19</strong> And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded.  <strong>20</strong> And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.  <strong>21</strong> And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.  <strong>22</strong> And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.  <strong>23</strong> All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.  <strong>24</strong> And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it  of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.  <strong>25</strong> And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.

But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The king's word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites.

Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So Gad went to David and said to him, \"Shall there come upon you three years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David said to Gad, \"I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, \"Enough! Withdraw your hand.\" The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the LORD, \"I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my family.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> On that day Gad went to David and said to him, \"Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So David went up, as the LORD had commanded through Gad. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When Araunah looked and saw the king and his men coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Araunah said, \"Why has my lord the king come to his servant?To buy your threshing floor,\" David answered, \"so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Araunah said to David, \"Let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> O king, Araunah gives all this to the king.\" Araunah also said to him, \"May the LORD your God accept you.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But the king replied to Araunah, \"No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.\" So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.

Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.  <strong>18</strong> And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was  of the sons of the giant.  <strong>19</strong> And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.  <strong>20</strong> And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great  stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.  <strong>21</strong> And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.  <strong>22</strong> These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, \"It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.) <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> David asked the Gibeonites, \"What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the LORD's inheritance?\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Gibeonites answered him, \"We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.What do you want me to do for you?\" David asked. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They answered the king, \"As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul-the Lord 's chosen one.\" So the king said, \"I will give them to you.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed and exposed them on a hill before the LORD. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds of the air touch them by day or the wild animals by night. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When David was told what Aiah's daughter Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had done, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had taken them secretly from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul's father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, \"Never again will you go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot-twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.

The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The rest of Kohath's descendants were allotted ten towns from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan and half of Manasseh. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The descendants of Gershon were allotted thirteen towns from the clans of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The descendants of Merari, clan by clan, received twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these towns and their pasturelands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> From the tribes of Judah and Simeon they allotted the following towns by name <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> (these towns were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them): <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They gave them Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pastureland, in the hill country of Judah.

Not one of their enemies withstood them; the LORD handed all their enemies over to them. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Not one of all the LORD's good promises to the house of Israel failed; every one was fulfilled.

 <strong>2</strong> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.  <strong>3</strong> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <strong>4</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <strong>6</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <strong>7</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.  <strong>8</strong> And he said unto me, Who art thou?

And he smote him that he died.  <strong>16</strong> And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’S anointed.  <strong>17</strong> And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:  <strong>18</strong> (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of  the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  <strong>19</strong> The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  <strong>20</strong> Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <strong>21</strong> Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.  <strong>22</strong> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  <strong>23</strong> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.  <strong>24</strong> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.  <strong>25</strong> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  <strong>26</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <strong>27</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me.

May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, \"Can this be Naomi?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Don't call me Naomi, \"she told them. \"Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
