But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p46011016_06-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you.

One goes hungry, another gets drunk. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in?

Do this in remembrance of me.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class=\"woc\">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</p>\n<p id=\"p46011026_06-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p>\n<p id=\"p46011032_06-23\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another—<b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment.

Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <strong>2</strong> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I

Now the famine was severe in Samaria. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018006_04-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>And he said, “How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, ‘He is not here,’ he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’ <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”’; and he will kill me.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018016_04-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father’s house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”</p>\n\n<p id=\"p11018019_09-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal’s prophets are 450 men. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>And you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, he is God.” And all the people answered, “It is well spoken.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018029_09-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, “Israel shall be your name,” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And he said, “Do it a second time.” And they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time.” And they did it a third time. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018035_09-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them.

And there was a sore famine in Samaria.  <strong>3</strong> And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his  house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:  <strong>4</strong> For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  <strong>5</strong> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.  <strong>6</strong> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  <strong>7</strong> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  <strong>8</strong> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>9</strong> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  <strong>10</strong> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is  not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  <strong>11</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>12</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  <strong>13</strong> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <strong>14</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here:  and he shall slay me.  <strong>15</strong> And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.  <strong>16</strong> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.  <strong>20</strong> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.  <strong>21</strong> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.  <strong>23</strong> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it  on wood, and put no fire under:  <strong>24</strong> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.  <strong>25</strong> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.  <strong>26</strong> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.  <strong>28</strong> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  <strong>30</strong> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.  <strong>31</strong> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:  <strong>32</strong> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.  <strong>33</strong> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it  the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  <strong>35</strong> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that  I have done all these things at thy word.  <strong>37</strong> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.  <strong>38</strong> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.  <strong>39</strong> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.  <strong>40</strong> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.  <strong>41</strong> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.  <strong>42</strong> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,  <strong>43</strong> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.  <strong>44</strong> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.  <strong>45</strong> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.  <strong>46</strong> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: \"Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Ahab had said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, \"Is it really you, my lord Elijah?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What have I done wrong,\" asked Obadiah, \"that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Elijah said, \"As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he saw Elijah, he said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have not made trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Elijah went before the people and said, \"How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.\" But the people said nothing. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to them, \"I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire-he is God.\" Then all the people said, \"What you say is good.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. \"O Baal, answer us!\" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At noon Elijah began to taunt them. \"Shout louder!\" he said. \"Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come here to me.\" They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Your name shall be Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Do it again,\" he said, and they did it again. \"Do it a third time,\" he ordered, and they did it the third time. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, \"The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Elijah commanded them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!\" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Go and look toward the sea,\" he told his servant. And he went up and looked. \"There is nothing there,\" he said. Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The seventh time the servant reported, \"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" So Elijah said, \"Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.

What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
