executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.  <strong>7</strong> He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.  <strong>8</strong> The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.  <strong>9</strong> He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.  <strong>10</strong> He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.  <strong>11</strong> For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.  <strong>12</strong> As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.  <strong>13</strong> Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.  <strong>14</strong> For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.  <strong>15</strong>             As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.  <strong>16</strong> For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.  <strong>17</strong> But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;  <strong>18</strong> To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.  <strong>19</strong> The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.  <strong>20</strong> Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.  <strong>21</strong> Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.  <strong>22</strong> Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
