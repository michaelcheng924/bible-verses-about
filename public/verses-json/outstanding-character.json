Joseph, being  seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.  <strong>3</strong> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many  colours.  <strong>4</strong> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.  <strong>5</strong> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:  <strong>7</strong> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.  <strong>8</strong> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.  <strong>9</strong> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.  <strong>10</strong> And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  <strong>11</strong> And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.  <strong>12</strong> And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.  <strong>13</strong> And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock  in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.  <strong>14</strong> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.  <strong>15</strong> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  <strong>16</strong> And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.  <strong>17</strong> And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.  <strong>18</strong> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.  <strong>19</strong> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.  <strong>20</strong> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.  <strong>21</strong> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.  <strong>22</strong> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;  <strong>24</strong> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was  empty, there was no water in it.  <strong>25</strong> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.  <strong>26</strong> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?  <strong>27</strong> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.  <strong>28</strong> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.  <strong>29</strong> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was  not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.  <strong>30</strong> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is  not; and I, whither shall I go?  <strong>31</strong> And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;  <strong>32</strong> And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son’s coat or no.  <strong>33</strong> And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.  <strong>34</strong> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.  <strong>35</strong> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented robe for him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Listen to this dream I had: <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> His brothers said to him, \"Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?\" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. \"Listen,\" he said, \"I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, \"What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and Israel said to Joseph, \"As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them.Very well,\" he replied. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So he said to him, \"Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me.\" Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, \"What are you looking for?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He replied, \"I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"They have moved on from here,\" the man answered. \"I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'\" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Here comes that dreamer!\" they said to each other. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. \"Let's not take his life,\" he said. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him.\" Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe-the richly ornamented robe he was wearing- <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Judah said to his brothers, \"What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.\" His brothers agreed. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He went back to his brothers and said, \"The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, \"We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He recognized it and said, \"It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. \"No,\" he said, \"in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son.\" So his father wept for him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.

Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity.

They are gossips, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.  <strong>19</strong> And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  <strong>20</strong> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.  <strong>21</strong> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)  <strong>22</strong> Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye  men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.  <strong>23</strong> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.  <strong>24</strong> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  <strong>25</strong> Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  <strong>26</strong> And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;  <strong>27</strong> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  <strong>28</strong> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.  <strong>29</strong> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.  <strong>30</strong> And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:  <strong>31</strong> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof  he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.  <strong>32</strong> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.  <strong>33</strong> So Paul departed from among them.  <strong>34</strong> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. \"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ, \"he said. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: \"These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, \"What is this babbler trying to say?\" Others remarked, \"He seems to be advocating foreign gods.\" They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, \"May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \"Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:|sc TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> 'For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man's design and skill. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, \"We want to hear you again on this subject.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At that, Paul left the Council. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.
