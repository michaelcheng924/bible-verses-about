He brought you water out of hard rock. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He gave you manna to eat in the desert, something your fathers had never known, to humble and to test you so that in the end it might go well with you. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You may say to yourself, \"My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your forefathers, as it is today. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Like the nations the LORD destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the LORD your God.

He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it.

His mother’s name also was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.  <strong>2</strong> And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.  <strong>3</strong> And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.  <strong>4</strong> And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.  <strong>5</strong> And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.  <strong>6</strong> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?  <strong>7</strong> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.  <strong>8</strong> And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid  upon Israel in the wilderness.  <strong>10</strong> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.  <strong>11</strong> Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.  <strong>12</strong> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.  <strong>14</strong> And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal,  and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.  <strong>15</strong> But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.  <strong>16</strong> And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.  <strong>17</strong> Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.  <strong>18</strong> And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.  <strong>19</strong> Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.  <strong>20</strong> And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.  <strong>21</strong> And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it. <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.  <strong>24</strong> For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.  <strong>25</strong> And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.  <strong>26</strong> And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.  <strong>27</strong> Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years of Jehoiada the priest. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the LORD. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, \"Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now.\" But the Levites did not act at once. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, \"Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king's officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD's temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the LORD's temple: articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They abandoned the temple of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Although the LORD sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, \"This is what God says: 'Why do you disobey the LORD's commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD's temple. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, \"May the LORD see this and call you to account.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> At the turn of the year, the army of Aram marched against Joash; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith a Moabite woman. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king. "}]}
