a man of knowledge increaseth strength.  <strong>6</strong> For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.  <strong>7</strong> Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.  <strong>8</strong> He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.  <strong>9</strong> The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is  an abomination to men.  <strong>10</strong> If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.  <strong>11</strong> If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;  <strong>12</strong> If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not  he know it? and shall not he render to every  man according to his works?  <strong>13</strong> My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:  <strong>14</strong> So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.  <strong>15</strong> Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:  <strong>16</strong> For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.  <strong>17</strong> Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:  <strong>18</strong> Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.  <strong>19</strong> Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked;  <strong>20</strong> For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be

the ruin of them both?  <strong>23</strong> These things also belong to the wise.

Further Sayings of the Wise <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good: <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Whoever says to the guilty, \"You are innocent\"- peoples will curse him and nations denounce him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not say, \"I'll do to him as he has done to me; I'll pay that man back for what he did.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> I went past the field of the sluggard, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw: <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.

and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?  <strong>3</strong> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.  <strong>4</strong> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:  <strong>5</strong> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  <strong>6</strong> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.  <strong>7</strong> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  <strong>8</strong> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.  <strong>9</strong> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.  <strong>10</strong> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.  <strong>11</strong> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.  <strong>12</strong> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.  <strong>13</strong> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.  <strong>14</strong> She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.  <strong>15</strong> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.  <strong>16</strong> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.  <strong>17</strong> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.  <strong>18</strong> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.  <strong>19</strong> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.  <strong>20</strong> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.  <strong>21</strong> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.  <strong>22</strong> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is  silk and purple.  <strong>23</strong> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.  <strong>24</strong> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  <strong>25</strong> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.  <strong>26</strong> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.  <strong>27</strong> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.  <strong>28</strong> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,  and he praiseth her.  <strong>29</strong> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.  <strong>30</strong> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but  a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.  <strong>31</strong> Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.

She is worth far more than rubies. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
