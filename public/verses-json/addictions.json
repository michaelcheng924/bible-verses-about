of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.  <strong>3</strong> I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.  <strong>4</strong> Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;  <strong>5</strong> I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.  <strong>6</strong> Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it?  I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.  <strong>7</strong> They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.  <strong>8</strong> Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.  <strong>9</strong> For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.  <strong>10</strong> Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.  <strong>11</strong> For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.  <strong>12</strong> Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.  <strong>13</strong> Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.  <strong>14</strong> All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.  <strong>15</strong> I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.  <strong>16</strong> Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.  <strong>17</strong> Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am  the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.  <strong>18</strong> O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:  <strong>19</strong> Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.  <strong>20</strong> Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.  <strong>21</strong> And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.  <strong>22</strong> There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

Will you not admit them? \"From now on I will tell you of new things, of hidden things unknown to you. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today. So you cannot say, 'Yes, I knew of them.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You have neither heard nor understood; from of old your ear has not been open. Well do I know how treacherous you are; you were called a rebel from birth. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For my own name's sake I delay my wrath; for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you, so as not to cut you off. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> See, I have refined you, though not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. How can I let myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Listen to me, O Jacob, Israel, whom I have called: I am he; I am the first and I am the last. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they all stand up together. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Come together, all of you, and listen: Which of the idols has foretold these things?

I will bring him, and he will succeed in his mission. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Come near me and listen to this: \"From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; at the time it happens, I am there.\" And now the Sovereign LORD has sent me, with his Spirit. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says- your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: \"I am the LORD your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your righteousness like the waves of the sea. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Your descendants would have been like the sand, your children like its numberless grains; their name would never be cut off nor destroyed from before me.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Leave Babylon, flee from the Babylonians! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth; say, \"The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and water gushed out. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"There is no peace,\" says the LORD, \"for the wicked.\"

For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.  <strong>9</strong> Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.  <strong>10</strong> In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.  <strong>11</strong> For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.  <strong>12</strong> Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.  <strong>13</strong> Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.  <strong>14</strong> We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.  <strong>15</strong> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.  <strong>16</strong> Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.  <strong>17</strong> But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?  <strong>18</strong> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  <strong>19</strong> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.  <strong>20</strong> For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.  <strong>21</strong> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.  <strong>22</strong> And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.  <strong>23</strong> And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.  <strong>24</strong> And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.  <strong>1</strong> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.  <strong>2</strong> Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:  <strong>3</strong> And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.  <strong>4</strong> Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.  <strong>5</strong> They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.  <strong>6</strong> We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.  <strong>7</strong> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  <strong>8</strong> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  <strong>9</strong> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  <strong>10</strong> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  <strong>11</strong> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.  <strong>12</strong> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.  <strong>13</strong> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  <strong>14</strong> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be  the Saviour of the world.  <strong>15</strong> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.  <strong>16</strong> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.  <strong>17</strong> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  <strong>18</strong> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  <strong>19</strong> We love him, because he first loved us.  <strong>20</strong> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  <strong>21</strong> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.  <strong>1</strong> Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.  <strong>2</strong> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.  <strong>3</strong> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.  <strong>4</strong> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.  <strong>5</strong> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?  <strong>6</strong> This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.  <strong>7</strong> For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.  <strong>8</strong> And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.  <strong>9</strong> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.  <strong>10</strong> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.  <strong>11</strong> And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  <strong>12</strong> He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.  <strong>13</strong> These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.  <strong>14</strong> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:  <strong>15</strong> And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  <strong>16</strong> If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.  <strong>17</strong> All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.  <strong>18</strong> We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.  <strong>19</strong> And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.  <strong>20</strong> And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.  <strong>21</strong> Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins.

God forbid.  <strong>18</strong> For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.  <strong>19</strong> For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.  <strong>20</strong> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.  <strong>21</strong> I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come  by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.  <strong>1</strong> O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?  <strong>2</strong> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  <strong>3</strong> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?  <strong>4</strong> Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.  <strong>5</strong> He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  <strong>6</strong> Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  <strong>7</strong> Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.  <strong>8</strong> And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.  <strong>9</strong> So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.  <strong>10</strong> For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.  <strong>11</strong> But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is  evident: for, The just shall live by faith.  <strong>12</strong> And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.  <strong>13</strong> Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:  <strong>14</strong> That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.  <strong>15</strong> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.  <strong>16</strong> Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.  <strong>17</strong> And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.  <strong>18</strong> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.  <strong>19</strong> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.  <strong>20</strong> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.  <strong>21</strong> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.  <strong>22</strong> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.  <strong>23</strong> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  <strong>24</strong> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <strong>25</strong> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.  <strong>26</strong> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  <strong>27</strong> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  <strong>28</strong> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  <strong>29</strong> And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.

I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of Israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.'\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month on the first day, the word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon drove his army in a hard campaign against Tyre; every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw. Yet he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as pay for his army. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army did it for me, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"On that day I will make a horn grow for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the LORD.\" "}]}
