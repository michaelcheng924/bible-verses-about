Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <strong>2</strong> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I
