Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  <strong>7</strong> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  <strong>8</strong> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  <strong>9</strong> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  <strong>10</strong> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is  in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> Give us this day our daily bread.  <strong>12</strong> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  <strong>13</strong> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
