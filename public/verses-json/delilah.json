And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.  <strong>3</strong> And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.  <strong>4</strong> And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.  <strong>5</strong> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces  of silver.  <strong>6</strong> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.  <strong>7</strong> And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  <strong>8</strong> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.  <strong>9</strong> Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.  <strong>10</strong> And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.  <strong>11</strong> And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  <strong>12</strong> Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.  <strong>13</strong> And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.  <strong>14</strong> And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.  <strong>15</strong> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;  <strong>17</strong> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her. There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.  <strong>18</strong> And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.  <strong>19</strong> And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.  <strong>20</strong> And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.  <strong>21</strong> But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.  <strong>22</strong> Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.  <strong>23</strong> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.  <strong>24</strong> And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.  <strong>25</strong> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.  <strong>26</strong> And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.  <strong>27</strong> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.  <strong>28</strong> And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.  <strong>29</strong> And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.  <strong>30</strong> And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.  <strong>31</strong> Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The people of Gaza were told, \"Samson is here!\" So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, \"At dawn we'll kill him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, \"See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Delilah said to Samson, \"Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Samson answered her, \"If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him with them. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> With men hidden in the room, she called to him, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Delilah said to Samson, \"You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He said, \"If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Delilah then said to Samson, \"Until now, you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied.\" He replied, \"If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I'll become as weak as any other man.\" So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then she said to him, \"How can you say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he told her everything. \"No razor has ever been used on my head,\" he said, \"because I have been a Nazirite set apart to God since birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, \"Come back once more; he has told me everything.\" So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Having put him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. And his strength left him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then she called, \"Samson, the Philistines are upon you!\" He awoke from his sleep and thought, \"I'll go out as before and shake myself free.\" But he did not know that the LORD had left him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, \"Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, \"Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> While they were in high spirits, they shouted, \"Bring out Samson to entertain us.\" So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Samson said to the servant who held his hand, \"Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Samson prayed to the LORD, \"O Sovereign LORD, remember me. O God, please strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Samson said, \"Let me die with the Philistines!\" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then his brothers and his father's whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel twenty years.
