This is he which received seed by the way side.  <strong>20</strong> But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;  <strong>21</strong> Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.  <strong>22</strong> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.  <strong>23</strong> But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. <strong>24</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:  <strong>25</strong> But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.  <strong>26</strong> But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.  <strong>27</strong> So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?  <strong>28</strong> He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  <strong>29</strong> But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.  <strong>30</strong> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. <strong>31</strong> Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:  <strong>32</strong> Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. <strong>33</strong> Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.  <strong>34</strong> All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:  <strong>35</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.  <strong>36</strong> Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;  <strong>38</strong> The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;  <strong>39</strong> The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.  <strong>40</strong> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.  <strong>41</strong> The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;  <strong>42</strong> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>43</strong> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. <strong>44</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. <strong>45</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:  <strong>46</strong> Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. <strong>47</strong>           Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:  <strong>48</strong> Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.  <strong>49</strong> So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,  <strong>50</strong> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>51</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?  They say unto him, Yea, Lord.  <strong>52</strong> Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is  instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. <strong>53</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.  <strong>54</strong> And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  <strong>55</strong> Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  <strong>56</strong> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?  <strong>57</strong> And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.  <strong>58</strong> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then he told them many things in parables, saying: \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He who has ears, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The disciples came to him and asked, \"Why do you speak to the people in parables?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He replied, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is why I speak to them in parables: \"Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: \"'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Listen then to what the parable of the sower means: <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"'An enemy did this,' he replied. \"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He told them another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He told them still another parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: \"I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He answered, \"The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"Have you understood all these things?\" Jesus asked. \"Yes,\" they replied. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. \"Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?\" they asked. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> \"Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.

Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.  <strong>11</strong> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.  <strong>12</strong> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.  <strong>14</strong> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.  <strong>15</strong> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.  <strong>16</strong> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,  <strong>17</strong> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.  <strong>18</strong> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.  <strong>19</strong> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.  <strong>20</strong> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.  <strong>21</strong> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.  <strong>22</strong> The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;  <strong>23</strong> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)  <strong>24</strong> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.  <strong>25</strong> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  <strong>26</strong> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.  <strong>27</strong> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.  <strong>28</strong> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  <strong>29</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  <strong>30</strong> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  <strong>31</strong> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.  <strong>32</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.  <strong>33</strong> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.  <strong>34</strong> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.  <strong>36</strong> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.  <strong>37</strong> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.  <strong>38</strong> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.  <strong>39</strong> And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.  <strong>40</strong> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>41</strong> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.  <strong>42</strong> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?  <strong>43</strong> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.  <strong>44</strong> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>45</strong> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.  <strong>47</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.  <strong>48</strong> I am that bread of life.  <strong>49</strong> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  <strong>50</strong> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.  <strong>51</strong> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.  <strong>52</strong> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  <strong>53</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.  <strong>54</strong> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>55</strong> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.  <strong>56</strong> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.  <strong>57</strong> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.  <strong>58</strong> This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.  <strong>59</strong> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.  <strong>60</strong> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,  said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  <strong>61</strong> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?  <strong>62</strong> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  <strong>63</strong> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.  <strong>64</strong> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.  <strong>65</strong> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. <strong>66</strong> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  <strong>67</strong> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  <strong>68</strong> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.  <strong>69</strong> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>70</strong> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?  <strong>71</strong> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Jewish Passover Feast was near. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Philip answered him, \"Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"from now on give us this bread.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> I am the bread of life. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)
