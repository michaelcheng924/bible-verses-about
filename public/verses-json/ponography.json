valleys of them that are overcome with wine!  <strong>2</strong> Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.  <strong>3</strong> The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:  <strong>4</strong> And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.  <strong>5</strong> In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,  <strong>6</strong> And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.  <strong>7</strong> But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.  <strong>8</strong> For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean. <strong>9</strong> Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.  <strong>10</strong> For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:  <strong>11</strong> For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.  <strong>12</strong> To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.  <strong>13</strong> But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and  there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.  <strong>14</strong> Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.  <strong>15</strong> Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:  <strong>16</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.  <strong>17</strong> Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.  <strong>18</strong> And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.  <strong>19</strong> From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.  <strong>20</strong> For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.  <strong>21</strong> For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.  <strong>22</strong> Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.  <strong>23</strong> Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.  <strong>24</strong> Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods of his ground?  <strong>25</strong> When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and rie in their place?  <strong>26</strong> For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.  <strong>27</strong> For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.  <strong>28</strong> Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.  <strong>29</strong> This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley- to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine! <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like a fig ripe before harvest- as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand, he swallows it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer: Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For it is: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> to whom he said, \"This is the resting place, let the weary rest\"; and, \"This is the place of repose\"- but they would not listen. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So then, the word of the LORD to them will become: Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there- so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You boast, \"We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood our hiding place.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So this is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through.\" The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon- to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> His God instructs him and teaches him the right way. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom.

The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins.

as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.  <strong>3</strong> The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath spoken this word.  <strong>4</strong> The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.  <strong>5</strong> The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.  <strong>6</strong> Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.  <strong>7</strong> The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.  <strong>8</strong> The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.  <strong>9</strong> They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.  <strong>10</strong> The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no man may come in.  <strong>11</strong> There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.  <strong>12</strong> In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.  <strong>13</strong> When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.  <strong>14</strong> They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.  <strong>15</strong> Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.  <strong>16</strong> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even  glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.  <strong>17</strong> Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.  <strong>19</strong> The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.  <strong>20</strong> The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.  <strong>22</strong> And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.  <strong>23</strong> Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.

The LORD has spoken this word. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the exalted of the earth languish. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The gaiety of the tambourines is stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The ruined city lies desolate; the entrance to every house is barred. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all gaiety is banished from the earth. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they acclaim the LORD's majesty. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; exalt the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the ends of the earth we hear singing: \"Glory to the Righteous One.\" But I said, \"I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray! With treachery the treacherous betray!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Terror and pit and snare await you, O people of the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. The floodgates of the heavens are opened, the foundations of the earth shake. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The earth is broken up, the earth is split asunder, the earth is thoroughly shaken. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls-never to rise again. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In that day the LORD will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and be punished after many days. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The moon will be abashed, the sun ashamed; for the LORD Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders, gloriously.
