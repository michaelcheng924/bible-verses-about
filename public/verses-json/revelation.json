There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He who was seated on the throne said, \"I am making everything new!\" Then he said, \"Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said to me: \"It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, \"Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits thick, by man's measurement, which the angel was using. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
