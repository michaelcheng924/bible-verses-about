Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher any more?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing?
