They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: \"These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea.

Some of them asked, \"What is this babbler trying to say?\" Others remarked, \"He seems to be advocating foreign gods.\" They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, \"May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \"Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:|sc TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.

As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man's design and skill. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, \"We want to hear you again on this subject.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At that, Paul left the Council. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.

So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with gladness.  <strong>13</strong> And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.  <strong>14</strong> And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.  <strong>15</strong> So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.  <strong>16</strong> And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul’s daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.  <strong>17</strong> And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.  <strong>19</strong> And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.  So all the people departed every one to his house.  <strong>20</strong> Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!  <strong>21</strong> And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.

Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> with the ark of God on it, and Ahio was walking in front of it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all their might before the LORD, with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums and cymbals. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then David was angry because the LORD's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, \"How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was not willing to take the ark of the LORD to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and his entire household. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now King David was told, \"The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God.\" So David went down and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When those who were carrying the ark of the LORD had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> while he and the entire house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him in her heart. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the LORD. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, \"How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> David said to Michal, \"It was before the LORD, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the LORD's people Israel-I will celebrate before the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death. "}]}
