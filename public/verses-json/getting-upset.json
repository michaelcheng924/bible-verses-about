devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.  <strong>3</strong> For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.  <strong>4</strong> And I heard another voice from heaven, saying,

Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is  the Lord God who judgeth her.  <strong>9</strong> And the kings

The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then I heard another voice from heaven say: \"Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done.

All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: \"With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's great men.

And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  <strong>24</strong> And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea.

Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  <strong>34</strong> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  <strong>35</strong> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  <strong>36</strong> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  <strong>37</strong> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <strong>38</strong> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  <strong>39</strong> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  <strong>40</strong> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  <strong>41</strong> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  <strong>42</strong> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  <strong>43</strong> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  <strong>44</strong> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  <strong>45</strong> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>46</strong> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  <strong>47</strong> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  <strong>48</strong> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.
