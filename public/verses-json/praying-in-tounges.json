The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014005_04-5\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014012_04-5\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014019_04-5\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>In the Law it is written, “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p46014025_06-5\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014033_06-5\">As in all the churches of the saints, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</p>\n<p id=\"p46014035_06-5\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46014040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>But all things should be done decently and in order.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>2</strong> For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.  <strong>16</strong> Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  <strong>17</strong> For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  <strong>18</strong> I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  <strong>19</strong> Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.  <strong>20</strong> Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.  <strong>21</strong> In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.  <strong>22</strong> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.  <strong>23</strong> If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  <strong>24</strong> But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:  <strong>25</strong> And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.  <strong>26</strong> How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.  <strong>27</strong> If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be  by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.  <strong>28</strong> But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.  <strong>29</strong> Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.  <strong>30</strong> If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.  <strong>31</strong> For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.  <strong>32</strong> And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  <strong>33</strong> For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.  <strong>34</strong> Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.  <strong>35</strong> And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.  <strong>36</strong> What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?  <strong>37</strong> If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.  <strong>38</strong> But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.  <strong>39</strong> Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.  <strong>40</strong> Let all things be done decently and in order.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In the Law it is written: \"Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me,\" says the Lord. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, \"God is really among you!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.

And they said, Unto John’s baptism.  <strong>4</strong> Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.  <strong>5</strong> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  <strong>6</strong> And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.  <strong>7</strong> And all the men were about twelve.  <strong>8</strong> And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.  <strong>9</strong> But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.  <strong>10</strong> And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.  <strong>11</strong> And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:  <strong>12</strong> So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.  <strong>13</strong> Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.  <strong>14</strong> And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and  chief of the priests, which did so.  <strong>15</strong> And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?  <strong>16</strong> And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  <strong>17</strong> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  <strong>18</strong> And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.  <strong>19</strong> Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.  <strong>20</strong> So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.  <strong>21</strong> After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.  <strong>22</strong> So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.  <strong>23</strong> And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.  <strong>24</strong> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;  <strong>25</strong> Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.  <strong>26</strong> Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:  <strong>27</strong> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.  <strong>28</strong> And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  <strong>29</strong> And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.  <strong>30</strong> And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.  <strong>31</strong> And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.  <strong>32</strong> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.  <strong>33</strong> And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.  <strong>34</strong> But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  <strong>35</strong> And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye  men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?  <strong>36</strong> Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.  <strong>37</strong> For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.  <strong>38</strong> Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.  <strong>39</strong> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.  <strong>40</strong> For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.  <strong>41</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and asked them, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" They answered, \"No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you receive?John's baptism,\" they replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> There were about twelve men in all. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, \"In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> One day the evil spirit answered them, \"Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. \"After I have been there,\" he said, \"I must visit Rome also.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: \"Men, you know we receive a good income from this business. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: \"Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
