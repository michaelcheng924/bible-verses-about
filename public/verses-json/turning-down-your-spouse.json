And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life! <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>But you yourselves wrong and defraud—even your own brothers!</p>\n<p id=\"p46006008_04-14\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?

I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.  <strong>16</strong> Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  <strong>17</strong> For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  <strong>18</strong> I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  <strong>19</strong> Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.  <strong>20</strong> Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.  <strong>21</strong> In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.  <strong>22</strong> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.  <strong>23</strong> If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  <strong>24</strong> But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:  <strong>25</strong> And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.  <strong>26</strong> How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.  <strong>27</strong> If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be  by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.  <strong>28</strong> But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.  <strong>29</strong> Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.  <strong>30</strong> If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.  <strong>31</strong> For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.  <strong>32</strong> And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  <strong>33</strong> For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.  <strong>34</strong> Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.  <strong>35</strong> And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.  <strong>36</strong> What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?  <strong>37</strong> If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.  <strong>38</strong> But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.  <strong>39</strong> Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.  <strong>40</strong> Let all things be done decently and in order.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In the Law it is written: \"Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me,\" says the Lord. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, \"God is really among you!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches.

And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.  <strong>19</strong> And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  <strong>20</strong> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.  <strong>21</strong> (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)  <strong>22</strong> Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye  men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.  <strong>23</strong> For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.  <strong>24</strong> God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  <strong>25</strong> Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  <strong>26</strong> And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;  <strong>27</strong> That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  <strong>28</strong> For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.  <strong>29</strong> Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.  <strong>30</strong> And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:  <strong>31</strong> Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof  he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.  <strong>32</strong> And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.  <strong>33</strong> So Paul departed from among them.  <strong>34</strong> Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. \"This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ, \"he said. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: \"These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, \"What is this babbler trying to say?\" Others remarked, \"He seems to be advocating foreign gods.\" They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, \"May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.) <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: \"Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription:|sc TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> 'For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man's design and skill. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, \"We want to hear you again on this subject.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At that, Paul left the Council. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.
