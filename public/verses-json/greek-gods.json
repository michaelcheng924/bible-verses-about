Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.  <strong>7</strong> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.  <strong>8</strong> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  <strong>9</strong> In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.  <strong>10</strong> Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.  <strong>11</strong> Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.  <strong>12</strong> No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.  <strong>13</strong> Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.  <strong>14</strong> And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be  the Saviour of the world.  <strong>15</strong> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.  <strong>16</strong> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.  <strong>17</strong> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.  <strong>18</strong> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  <strong>19</strong> We love him, because he first loved us.  <strong>20</strong> If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?  <strong>21</strong> And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.  <strong>1</strong> Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.  <strong>2</strong> By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.  <strong>3</strong> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.  <strong>4</strong> For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.  <strong>5</strong> Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?  <strong>6</strong> This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.  <strong>7</strong> For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.  <strong>8</strong> And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.  <strong>9</strong> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.  <strong>10</strong> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.  <strong>11</strong> And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  <strong>12</strong> He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.  <strong>13</strong> These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.  <strong>14</strong> And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:  <strong>15</strong> And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  <strong>16</strong> If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.  <strong>17</strong> All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.  <strong>18</strong> We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.  <strong>19</strong> And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.  <strong>20</strong> And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ.

Like a corpse trampled underfoot, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"I will rise up against them,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \"I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors, her offspring and descendants,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,\" declares the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn, \"Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Wail, O gate! Howl, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? \"The LORD has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.\" "},{"_id":"616244138d436e0b7f06a899","topicId":"6162440f8d436e0b7f06a88e","verse":"Leviticus 24:16","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p03024016_01-13\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v03024016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death.
