of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.  <strong>4</strong> Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.  <strong>5</strong> And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.  <strong>6</strong> We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but  his lies shall not be so.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.  <strong>8</strong> For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.  <strong>10</strong> And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.  <strong>11</strong> Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-haresh.  <strong>12</strong> And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail.  <strong>13</strong> This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab since that time.  <strong>14</strong> But now the LORD hath

Lament and grieve for the men of Kir Hareseth. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The fields of Heshbon wither, the vines of Sibmah also. The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines, which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the vines of Sibmah. O Heshbon, O Elealeh, I drench you with tears! The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards; no one sings or shouts in the vineyards; no one treads out wine at the presses, for I have put an end to the shouting. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> My heart laments for Moab like a harp, my inmost being for Kir Hareseth. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Moab appears at her high place, she only wears herself out; when she goes to her shrine to pray, it is to no avail. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> This is the word the LORD has already spoken concerning Moab. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But now the LORD says: \"Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them, Moab's splendor and all her many people will be despised, and her survivors will be very few and feeble.\" "},{"_id":"6158df3b70e3c15fe7a5ae38","topicId":"6158df3b70e3c15fe7a5ae36","verse":"Isaiah 29:1-24","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p23029001_05-2\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v23029001-1\">29:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Ariel, Ariel,</span><br><span id=\"p23029001_05-2\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city where David encamped!</span><br><span id=\"p23029001_05-2\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Add year to year;</span><br><span id=\"p23029001_05-2\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the feasts run their round.</span><br><span id=\"p23029002_05-2\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23029002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I will distress Ariel,</span><br><span id=\"p23029002_05-2\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there shall be moaning and lamentation,</span><br><span id=\"p23029002_05-2\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she shall be to me like an Ariel.</span><br><span id=\"p23029003_05-2\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23029003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will encamp against you all around,</span><br><span id=\"p23029003_05-2\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will besiege you with towers</span><br><span id=\"p23029003_05-2\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will raise siegeworks against you.</span><br><span id=\"p23029004_05-2\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23029004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;And you will be brought low;

Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth; out of the dust your speech will whisper. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But your many enemies will become like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> the LORD Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel, that attack her and her fortress and besiege her, will be as it is with a dream, with a vision in the night- <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he awakens, and his hunger remains; as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Be stunned and amazed, blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not from wine, stagger, but not from beer. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The LORD has brought over you a deep sleep: He has sealed your eyes (the prophets); he has covered your heads (the seers). <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him, \"Read this, please,\" he will answer, \"I can't; it is sealed.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, \"Read this, please,\" he will answer, \"I don't know how to read.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The Lord says: \"These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the LORD, who do their work in darkness and think, \"Who sees us? Who will know?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, \"He did not make me\"? Can the pot say of the potter, \"He knows nothing\"? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Once more the humble will rejoice in the LORD; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down- <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> those who with a word make a man out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob: \"No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they see among them their children, the work of my hands, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding; those who complain will accept instruction.\"

Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;  <strong>2</strong> He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads shall be  baldness, and every beard cut off.  <strong>3</strong> In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.  <strong>4</strong> And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.  <strong>5</strong> My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee  unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.  <strong>6</strong> For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.  <strong>8</strong> For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.  <strong>9</strong> For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> An oracle concerning Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Dimon's waters are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon - a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.
