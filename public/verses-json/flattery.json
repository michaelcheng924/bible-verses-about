<strong>26</strong> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men  have been slain by her.  <strong>27</strong> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Say to wisdom, \"You are my sister,\" and call understanding your kinsman; <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home; <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said: <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"I have fellowship offerings at home; today I fulfilled my vows. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.
