Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then a voice told him, \"Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Surely not, Lord!\" Peter replied. \"I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The voice spoke to him a second time, \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, \"Simon, three men are looking for you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Peter went down and said to the men, \"I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men replied, \"We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Peter made him get up. \"Stand up,\" he said, \"I am only a man myself.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to them: \"You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cornelius answered: \"Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

Amen.  <strong>26</strong> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  <strong>27</strong> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  <strong>28</strong> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  <strong>29</strong> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  <strong>30</strong> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  <strong>31</strong> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  <strong>32</strong> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God-- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong-- <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: \"The righteous will live by faith.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

the inhabitants of the land, because there is  no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.  <strong>2</strong> By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.  <strong>3</strong> Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.  <strong>4</strong> Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are  as they that strive with the priest.  <strong>5</strong> Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.  <strong>6</strong> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.  <strong>7</strong> As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore  will I change their glory into shame.  <strong>8</strong> They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.  <strong>9</strong> And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.  <strong>10</strong> For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.  <strong>11</strong> Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.  <strong>12</strong> My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.  <strong>13</strong> They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is  good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.  <strong>14</strong> I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.  <strong>15</strong> Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.  <strong>16</strong> For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.  <strong>17</strong> Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.  <strong>18</strong> Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.  <strong>19</strong> The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.

I will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"They will eat but not have enough; they will engage in prostitution but not increase, because they have deserted the LORD to give themselves <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> to prostitution, to old wine and new, which take away the understanding <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> of my people. They consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitution leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills, under oak, poplar and terebinth, where the shade is pleasant. Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes- a people without understanding will come to ruin! <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Though you commit adultery, O Israel, let not Judah become guilty. \"Do not go to Gilgal; do not go up to Beth Aven. And do not swear, 'As surely as the LORD lives!' <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The Israelites are stubborn, like a stubborn heifer.
