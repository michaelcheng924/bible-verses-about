","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> In reply Jesus declared, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"How can a man be born when he is old?\" Nicodemus asked. \"Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"6162416e8d436e0b7f06a6f7","topicId":"6162416c8d436e0b7f06a6f0","verse":"1 Kings 10:9-12","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p11010009_01-9\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11010009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel!

He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths.\" The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So man will be brought low and mankind humbled- do not forgive them. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled), <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> for all the towering mountains and all the high hills, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> for every lofty tower and every fortified wall, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> for every trading ship and every stately vessel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and the idols will totally disappear. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Stop trusting in man, who has but a breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?
