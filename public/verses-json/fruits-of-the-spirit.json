This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he may be. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The entire law is summed up in a single command: \"Love your neighbor as yourself.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
