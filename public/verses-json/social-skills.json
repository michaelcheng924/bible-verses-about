You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> and Abimelech asked Abraham, \"What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He replied, \"Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
