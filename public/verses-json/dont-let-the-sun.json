","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> There is one body and one Spirit--just as you were called to one hope when you were called-- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> one Lord, one faith, one baptism; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> This is why it says: \"When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> (What does \"he ascended\" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You, however, did not come to know Christ that way. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> to be made new in the attitude of your minds; <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"In your anger do not sin\": Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and do not give the devil a foothold. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. ) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \"'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\") <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ). <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone.
