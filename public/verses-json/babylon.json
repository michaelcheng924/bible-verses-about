linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!  <strong>17</strong> For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  <strong>18</strong> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!  <strong>19</strong> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.  <strong>20</strong> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.  <strong>21</strong> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <strong>22</strong> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <strong>23</strong> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  <strong>24</strong> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> With a mighty voice he shouted: \"Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit, a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then I heard another voice from heaven say: \"Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Mix her a double portion from her own cup. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, 'I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more-- <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"They will say, 'The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: \"With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's great men.

They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> See, the day of the LORD is coming -a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger- to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I will make man scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives ravished. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the glory of the Babylonians' pride, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flocks there. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged. ","modified":"2022-10-04T03:42:08.529Z"}]}
