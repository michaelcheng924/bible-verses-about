And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.  <strong>3</strong> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.  <strong>4</strong> And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.  <strong>5</strong> But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.  <strong>6</strong> Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.  <strong>7</strong> And there was one named Barabbas, which lay  bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.  <strong>8</strong> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do  as he had ever done unto them.  <strong>9</strong> But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  <strong>10</strong> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.  <strong>11</strong> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.  <strong>12</strong> And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?  <strong>13</strong> And they cried out again, Crucify him.  <strong>14</strong> Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.  <strong>15</strong> And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.  <strong>16</strong> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.  <strong>17</strong> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,  <strong>18</strong> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!  <strong>19</strong> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.  <strong>20</strong> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.  <strong>21</strong> And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.  <strong>22</strong> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.  <strong>23</strong> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.  <strong>24</strong> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.  <strong>25</strong> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.  <strong>26</strong> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>27</strong> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.  <strong>28</strong> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.  <strong>29</strong> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,  <strong>30</strong> Save thyself, and come down from the cross.  <strong>31</strong> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.  <strong>32</strong> Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.  <strong>33</strong> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.  <strong>34</strong> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <strong>35</strong> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.  <strong>36</strong> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it  on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.  <strong>37</strong> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.  <strong>38</strong> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.  <strong>39</strong> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.  <strong>40</strong> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;  <strong>41</strong> (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.  <strong>42</strong> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,  <strong>43</strong> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.  <strong>44</strong> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him  the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.  <strong>45</strong> And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.  <strong>47</strong> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate. \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The chief priests accused him of many things. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So again Pilate asked him, \"Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?\" Pilate asked them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Crucify him!\" they shouted. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And they began to call out to him, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It was the third hour when they crucified him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \"So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> come down from the cross and save yourself!\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\" Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When some of those standing near heard this, they said, \"Listen, he's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,\" he said. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, \"Surely this man was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!  <strong>25</strong> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>26</strong> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.  <strong>28</strong> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,  <strong>30</strong> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.  <strong>31</strong> But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. <strong>32</strong> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,  <strong>33</strong> Saying,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:  <strong>34</strong> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. <strong>35</strong> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.  <strong>36</strong> And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?  <strong>37</strong> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.  <strong>38</strong> But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  <strong>39</strong> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  <strong>40</strong> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.  <strong>41</strong> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.  <strong>42</strong> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  <strong>43</strong> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:  <strong>44</strong> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.  <strong>45</strong> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <strong>46</strong> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.  <strong>47</strong> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>48</strong> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>49</strong> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  <strong>50</strong> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  <strong>52</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"What did Moses command you?\" he replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They said, \"Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He answered, \"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, \"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \"Good teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good--except God alone. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" he declared, \"all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \"Who then can be saved?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Peter said to him, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus replied, \"no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"We are going up to Jerusalem,\" he said, \"and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" he asked. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They replied, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You don't know what you are asking,\" Jesus said. \"Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We can,\" they answered. Jesus said to them, \"You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" So they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, \"Rabbi, I want to see.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"Go,\" said Jesus, \"your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. \"Sovereign Lord,\" they said, \"you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: \"'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One. ' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement), <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.

 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.  <strong>4</strong> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.  <strong>5</strong> Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his  fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.  <strong>8</strong> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.  <strong>9</strong> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.  <strong>11</strong> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, and hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.  <strong>12</strong> Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  <strong>13</strong> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.  <strong>14</strong> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.  <strong>15</strong> So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.  <strong>16</strong> He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.  <strong>17</strong> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.  <strong>18</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.  <strong>19</strong> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>20</strong> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  <strong>21</strong> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?  <strong>22</strong> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.  <strong>23</strong> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?  <strong>24</strong> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.  <strong>25</strong> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"I'm going out to fish,\" Simon Peter told them, and they said, \"We'll go with you.\" So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He called out to them, \"Friends, haven't you any fish?No,\" they answered. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He said, \"Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\" When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, \"It is the Lord!\" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, \"It is the Lord,\" he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Bring some of the fish you have just caught.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Come and have breakfast.\" None of the disciples dared ask him, \"Who are you?\" They knew it was the Lord. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?Yes, Lord,\" he said, \"you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Feed my lambs.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again Jesus said, \"Simon son of John, do you truly love me?\" He answered, \"Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.\" Jesus said, \"Take care of my sheep.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The third time he said to him, \"Simon son of John, do you love me?\" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, \"Do you love me?\" He said, \"Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Feed my sheep. I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, \"Follow me!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, \"Lord, who is going to betray you?\") <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Peter saw him, he asked, \"Lord, what about him?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, \"If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down.

And they murmured against her.  <strong>6</strong> And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.  <strong>7</strong> For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.  <strong>8</strong> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.  <strong>9</strong> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. <strong>10</strong> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.  <strong>11</strong> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.  <strong>12</strong> And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  <strong>13</strong> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.  <strong>14</strong> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  <strong>15</strong> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and  prepared: there make ready for us.  <strong>16</strong> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.  <strong>17</strong> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.  <strong>18</strong> And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.  <strong>19</strong> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?  <strong>20</strong> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.  <strong>21</strong> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. <strong>22</strong> And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.  <strong>23</strong> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it  to them: and they all drank of it.  <strong>24</strong> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.  <strong>25</strong> Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. <strong>26</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.  <strong>28</strong> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>29</strong> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will  not I.  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>31</strong> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.  <strong>32</strong> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.  <strong>33</strong> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;  <strong>34</strong> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.  <strong>35</strong> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.  <strong>36</strong> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.  <strong>37</strong> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  <strong>38</strong> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>39</strong> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.  <strong>40</strong> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.  <strong>41</strong> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>42</strong> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. <strong>43</strong> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.  <strong>44</strong> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.  <strong>45</strong> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.  <strong>46</strong> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.  <strong>47</strong> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  <strong>48</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?  <strong>49</strong> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.  <strong>50</strong> And they all forsook him, and fled.  <strong>51</strong> And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:  <strong>52</strong> And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.  <strong>53</strong> And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.  <strong>54</strong> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.  <strong>55</strong> And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.  <strong>56</strong> For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.  <strong>57</strong> And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,  <strong>58</strong> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.  <strong>59</strong> But neither so did their witness agree together.  <strong>60</strong> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>61</strong> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?  <strong>62</strong> And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>63</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?  <strong>64</strong> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.  <strong>65</strong> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.  <strong>66</strong> And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:  <strong>67</strong> And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>68</strong> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.  <strong>69</strong> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.  <strong>70</strong> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.  <strong>71</strong> But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.  <strong>72</strong> And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"But not during the Feast,\" they said, \"or the people may riot.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, \"Why this waste of perfume? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor.\" And they rebuked her harshly. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" said Jesus. \"Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, \"Surely not I?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"It is one of the Twelve,\" he replied, \"one who dips bread into the bowl with me. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take it; this is my body.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,\" he said to them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You will all fall away,\" Jesus told them, \"for it is written: \"'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Peter declared, \"Even if all fall away, I will not.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Peter insisted emphatically, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the others said the same. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,\" he said to them. \"Stay here and keep watch.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Abba, Father,\" he said, \"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Simon,\" he said to Peter, \"are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Returning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Then everyone deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> \"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. \"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.

A certain  man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it,  and digged a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.  <strong>2</strong> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.  <strong>3</strong> And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.  <strong>4</strong> And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him  away shamefully handled.  <strong>5</strong> And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.  <strong>6</strong> Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.  <strong>7</strong> But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.  <strong>8</strong> And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.  <strong>9</strong> What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.  <strong>10</strong> And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:  <strong>11</strong> This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?  <strong>12</strong> And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.  <strong>13</strong> And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.  <strong>14</strong> And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?  <strong>15</strong> Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may seeit.  <strong>16</strong> And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.  <strong>18</strong> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  <strong>19</strong> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  <strong>20</strong> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  <strong>21</strong> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.  <strong>22</strong> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  <strong>23</strong> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  <strong>24</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  <strong>25</strong> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.  <strong>26</strong> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am  the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  <strong>27</strong> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. <strong>28</strong> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:  <strong>30</strong> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  <strong>31</strong> And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.  <strong>32</strong> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  <strong>33</strong> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  <strong>34</strong> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?  <strong>36</strong> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  <strong>37</strong> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,  <strong>39</strong> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:  <strong>40</strong> Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. <strong>41</strong> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.  <strong>42</strong> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.  <strong>43</strong> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:  <strong>44</strong> For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

And whose inscription?Caesar's,\" they replied. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.\" And they were amazed at him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" they said, \"Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now there were seven brothers.

You are badly mistaken!\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, \"How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\" The large crowd listened to him with delight. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> As he taught, Jesus said, \"Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers.

And he went round about the villages, teaching.  <strong>7</strong> And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;  <strong>8</strong> And commanded them that they should take nothing for their  journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their  purse:  <strong>9</strong> But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.  <strong>10</strong> And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.  <strong>11</strong> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.  <strong>12</strong> And they went out, and preached that men should repent.  <strong>13</strong> And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.  <strong>14</strong> And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  <strong>15</strong> Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.  <strong>16</strong> But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.  <strong>17</strong> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.  <strong>18</strong> For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.  <strong>19</strong> Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:  <strong>20</strong> For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.  <strong>21</strong> And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;  <strong>22</strong> And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.  <strong>24</strong> And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.  <strong>25</strong> And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.  <strong>26</strong> And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.  <strong>27</strong> And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,  <strong>28</strong> And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.  <strong>29</strong> And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.  <strong>30</strong> And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.  <strong>31</strong> And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.  <strong>32</strong> And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.  <strong>33</strong> And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.  <strong>34</strong> And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.  <strong>35</strong> And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:  <strong>36</strong> Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?  <strong>38</strong> He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see.

Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And he was amazed at their lack of faith. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> These were his instructions: \"Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Wear sandals but not an extra tunic. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They went out and preached that people should repent. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said to him, \"That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\" When they found out, they said, \"Five--and two fish.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They all ate and were satisfied, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> because they all saw him and were terrified. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.

and how then will ye know all parables? <strong>14</strong>           The sower soweth the word.  <strong>15</strong> And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts.  <strong>16</strong> And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;  <strong>17</strong> And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.  <strong>18</strong> And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,  <strong>19</strong> And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.  <strong>20</strong> And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred. <strong>21</strong> And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?  <strong>22</strong> For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.  <strong>23</strong> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>24</strong> And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given.  <strong>25</strong> For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.  <strong>26</strong> And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;  <strong>27</strong> And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.  <strong>28</strong> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.  <strong>29</strong> But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. <strong>30</strong> And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?  <strong>31</strong> It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:  <strong>32</strong> But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.  <strong>33</strong> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.  <strong>34</strong> But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.  <strong>35</strong> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.  <strong>36</strong> And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship.

A farmer went out to sow his seed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He told them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> so that, \"'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The farmer sows the word. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Consider carefully what you hear,\" he continued. \"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Again he said, \"What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, \"Let us go over to the other side.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, \"Teacher, don't you care if we drown?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, \"Quiet! Be still!\" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> He said to his disciples, \"Why are you so afraid?

And he arose and followed him.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.  <strong>16</strong> And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?  <strong>17</strong> When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  <strong>18</strong> And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?  <strong>19</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.  <strong>20</strong> But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.  <strong>21</strong> No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse.  <strong>22</strong> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.  <strong>24</strong> And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?  <strong>25</strong> And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?  <strong>26</strong> How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?  <strong>27</strong> And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:  <strong>28</strong> Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Son, your sins are forgiven.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, \"Why are you thinking these things? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....\" He said to the paralytic, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and \"sinners\" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the \"sinners\" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> On hearing this, Jesus said to them, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, \"How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The Pharisees said to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He answered, \"Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then he said to them, \"The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.\" "},{"_id":"616cd6f4e9d39d04b3b60113","topicId":"616cd6ece9d39d04b3b600fd","verse":"Matthew 5:43-48","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p40005043_04-23\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40005043-1\">43&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40005044-1\">44&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40005045-1\">45&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.
