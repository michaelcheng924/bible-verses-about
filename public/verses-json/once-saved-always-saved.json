I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp, doubleedged sword. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I know where you live-where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city-where Satan lives. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets (I will not impose any other burden on you): <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Only hold on to what you have until I come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations-- <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> 'He will rule them with an iron scepter; he will dash them to pieces like pottery'-- <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> just as I have received authority from my Father. I will also give him the morning star. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
