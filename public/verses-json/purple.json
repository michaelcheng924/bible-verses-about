And she constrained us.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:  <strong>17</strong> The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.  <strong>18</strong> And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.

Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, \"In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!\" At that moment the spirit left her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> They brought them before the magistrates and said, \"These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But Paul shouted, \"Don't harm yourself! We are all here!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He then brought them out and asked, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> They replied, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God--he and his whole family. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: \"Release those men.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The jailer told Paul, \"The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But Paul said to the officers: \"They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and encouraged them.

This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you.

And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.  <strong>24</strong> And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.  <strong>25</strong> And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.  <strong>26</strong> But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.  <strong>27</strong> And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.  <strong>28</strong> And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.  <strong>29</strong> Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?  <strong>30</strong> And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,  <strong>31</strong> And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.  <strong>32</strong> Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.  <strong>33</strong> Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.  <strong>34</strong> Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  <strong>35</strong> But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  <strong>36</strong> The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  <strong>37</strong> That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  <strong>38</strong> How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  <strong>39</strong> And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  <strong>40</strong> Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  <strong>41</strong> Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  <strong>42</strong> And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  <strong>43</strong> To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  <strong>44</strong> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  <strong>45</strong> And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>46</strong> For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  <strong>47</strong> Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  <strong>48</strong> And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, \"Cornelius!\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Cornelius stared at him in fear. \"What is it, Lord?\" he asked. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then a voice told him, \"Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Surely not, Lord!\" Peter replied. \"I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The voice spoke to him a second time, \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, \"Simon, three men are looking for you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Peter went down and said to the men, \"I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men replied, \"We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Peter made him get up. \"Stand up,\" he said, \"I am only a man myself.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to them: \"You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cornelius answered: \"Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The Spirit told Philip, \"Go to that chariot and stay near it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: \"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \"Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.

So he divided his property between them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So he got up and went to his father. \"But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him.

And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.  <strong>37</strong> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,  <strong>38</strong> And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.  <strong>39</strong> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  <strong>40</strong> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.  <strong>41</strong> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.  <strong>42</strong> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?  <strong>43</strong> Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.  <strong>44</strong> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.  <strong>45</strong> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.  <strong>46</strong> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.  <strong>47</strong> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.  <strong>49</strong> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  <strong>50</strong> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, \"This man deserves to have you do this, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: \"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, \"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, \"Don't cry.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They were all filled with awe and praised God. \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" they said. \"God has come to help his people.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> he sent them to the Lord to ask, \"Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When the men came to Jesus, they said, \"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So he replied to the messengers, \"Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> This is the one about whom it is written: \"'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: \"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and \"sinners.\"' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.Tell me, teacher,\" he said. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Simon replied, \"I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.You have judged correctly,\" Jesus said. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The other guests began to say among themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\" "},{"_id":"616a1333bda5ba8d73708f70","topicId":"616a132cbda5ba8d73708f59","verse":"Luke 3:16","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p42003016_01-23\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v42003016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but he who is mightier than I is coming, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.

And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  <strong>40</strong> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.  <strong>41</strong> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.  <strong>42</strong> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  <strong>43</strong> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:  <strong>44</strong> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.  <strong>45</strong> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <strong>46</strong> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.  <strong>47</strong> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>48</strong> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>49</strong> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  <strong>50</strong> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  <strong>52</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"What did Moses command you?\" he replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They said, \"Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He answered, \"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, \"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \"Good teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good--except God alone. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" he declared, \"all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \"Who then can be saved?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Peter said to him, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus replied, \"no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"We are going up to Jerusalem,\" he said, \"and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" he asked. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They replied, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You don't know what you are asking,\" Jesus said. \"Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We can,\" they answered. Jesus said to them, \"You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" So they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, \"Rabbi, I want to see.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"Go,\" said Jesus, \"your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
