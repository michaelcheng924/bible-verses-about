Then they brought these men before the king.  <strong>14</strong> Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?  <strong>15</strong> Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?  <strong>16</strong> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.  <strong>17</strong> If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.  <strong>18</strong> But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.  <strong>19</strong> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.  <strong>20</strong> And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them  into the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>21</strong> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.  <strong>23</strong> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  <strong>24</strong> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?

They neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Furious with rage, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and Nebuchadnezzar said to them, \"Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold I have set up? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Now when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes and all kinds of music, if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made, very good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace. Then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego replied to the king, \"O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from it, and he will rescue us from your hand, O king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But even if he does not, we want you to know, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, and his attitude toward them changed. He ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So these men, wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The king's command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and these three men, firmly tied, fell into the blazing furnace. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers, \"Weren't there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire?\" They replied, \"Certainly, O king.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said, \"Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, \"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!\" So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and the satraps, prefects, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies, nor was a hair of their heads singed; their robes were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar said, \"Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who has sent his angel and rescued his servants! They trusted in him and defied the king's command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble, for no other god can save in this way.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon.

 <strong>3</strong> It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,  <strong>4</strong> That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.  <strong>5</strong> There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.  <strong>6</strong> And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.  <strong>7</strong> And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,  <strong>9</strong> According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.  <strong>10</strong> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.  <strong>11</strong> And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.  <strong>12</strong> And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.  <strong>13</strong> But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.  <strong>14</strong> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.  <strong>15</strong> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.  <strong>16</strong> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.  <strong>17</strong> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.  <strong>18</strong> And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.  <strong>19</strong> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.  <strong>20</strong> And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.  <strong>21</strong> And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.  <strong>22</strong> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.  <strong>24</strong> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,  <strong>25</strong> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.  <strong>26</strong> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,  <strong>27</strong> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.  <strong>28</strong> And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art  highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art  thou among women.  <strong>29</strong> And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.  <strong>30</strong> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.  <strong>31</strong> And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.  <strong>32</strong> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:  <strong>33</strong> And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.  <strong>34</strong> Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?  <strong>35</strong> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.  <strong>36</strong> And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.  <strong>37</strong> For with God nothing shall be impossible.  <strong>38</strong> And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.  <strong>39</strong> And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;  <strong>40</strong> And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.  <strong>41</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:  <strong>42</strong> And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art  thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.  <strong>43</strong> And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?  <strong>44</strong> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.  <strong>45</strong> And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.  <strong>46</strong> And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,  <strong>47</strong> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.  <strong>48</strong> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.  <strong>49</strong> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is  his name.  <strong>50</strong> And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.  <strong>51</strong> He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.  <strong>52</strong> He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.  <strong>53</strong> He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.  <strong>54</strong> He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his  mercy;  <strong>55</strong> As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.  <strong>56</strong> And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.  <strong>57</strong> Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.  <strong>58</strong> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.  <strong>59</strong> And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.  <strong>60</strong> And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.  <strong>61</strong> And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.  <strong>62</strong> And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.  <strong>63</strong> And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.  <strong>64</strong> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,  and he spake, and praised God.  <strong>65</strong> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.  <strong>66</strong> And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.  <strong>67</strong> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,  <strong>68</strong> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,  <strong>69</strong> And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;  <strong>70</strong> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:  <strong>71</strong> That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;  <strong>72</strong> To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;  <strong>73</strong> The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,  <strong>74</strong> That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,  <strong>75</strong> In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.  <strong>76</strong> And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;  <strong>77</strong> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,  <strong>78</strong> Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,  <strong>79</strong> To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.  <strong>80</strong> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Zechariah asked the angel, \"How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When his time of service was completed, he returned home. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said. \"In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The angel went to her and said, \"Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"How will this be,\" Mary asked the angel, \"since I am a virgin?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The angel answered, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.

Don't be afraid.\" So he entered her tent, and she put a covering over him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"I'm thirsty,\" he said. \"Please give me some water.\" She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Stand in the doorway of the tent,\" he told her. \"If someone comes by and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say 'No.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted.

And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.  <strong>6</strong> And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.  <strong>7</strong> And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.  <strong>8</strong> And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.  <strong>9</strong> And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.  <strong>10</strong> And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.  <strong>11</strong> And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one  called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,  <strong>12</strong> And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.  <strong>13</strong> Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:  <strong>14</strong> And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.  <strong>15</strong> But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:  <strong>16</strong> For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.  <strong>17</strong> And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>18</strong> And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.  <strong>19</strong> And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.  <strong>20</strong> And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.  <strong>21</strong> But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?  <strong>22</strong> But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.  <strong>23</strong> And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:  <strong>24</strong> But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.  <strong>25</strong> Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.  <strong>26</strong> And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.  <strong>27</strong> But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.  <strong>28</strong> And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.  <strong>29</strong> And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.  <strong>30</strong> Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.  <strong>31</strong> Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.  <strong>32</strong> And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters,  he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.  <strong>33</strong> And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.  <strong>34</strong> And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.  <strong>35</strong> And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.  <strong>36</strong> Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.  <strong>37</strong> And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.  <strong>38</strong> And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him  that he would not delay to come to them.  <strong>39</strong> Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.  <strong>40</strong> But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.  <strong>41</strong> And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.  <strong>42</strong> And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.  <strong>43</strong> And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, \"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Who are you, Lord?\" Saul asked. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,\" he replied. \"Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, \"Ananias!Yes, Lord,\" he answered. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The Lord told him, \"Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Lord,\" Ananias answered, \"I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the Lord said to Ananias, \"Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, \"Brother Saul, the Lord--Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and after taking some food, he regained his strength. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> All those who heard him were astonished and asked, \"Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the saints in Lydda. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Aeneas,\" Peter said to him, \"Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat.\" Immediately Aeneas got up. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas ), who was always doing good and helping the poor. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, \"Please come at once!\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, \"Tabitha, get up.\" She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
