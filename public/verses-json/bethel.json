And the Canaanite was then in the land.  <strong>7</strong> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.  <strong>8</strong> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.  <strong>10</strong> And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:  <strong>12</strong> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.  <strong>13</strong> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.  <strong>15</strong> The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.  <strong>16</strong> And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.  <strong>17</strong> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.  <strong>18</strong> And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that  thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was  thy wife?  <strong>19</strong> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.  <strong>20</strong> And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.  <strong>1</strong> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.  <strong>2</strong> And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.  <strong>3</strong> And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;  <strong>4</strong> Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.  <strong>5</strong> And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.  <strong>6</strong> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.  <strong>7</strong> And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.  <strong>8</strong> And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.  <strong>9</strong> Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.  <strong>10</strong> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.  <strong>11</strong> Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.  <strong>12</strong> Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.  <strong>13</strong> But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:  <strong>15</strong> For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.  <strong>16</strong> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.  <strong>17</strong> Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.  <strong>18</strong> Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;  <strong>2</strong> That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.  <strong>3</strong> All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.  <strong>4</strong> Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.  <strong>5</strong> And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,  <strong>6</strong> And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is  by the wilderness.  <strong>7</strong> And they returned, and came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezon-tamar.  <strong>8</strong> And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;  <strong>9</strong> With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.  <strong>10</strong> And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.  <strong>11</strong> And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.  <strong>12</strong> And they took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.  <strong>13</strong> And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.  <strong>14</strong> And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.  <strong>15</strong> And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.  <strong>16</strong> And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.  <strong>17</strong> And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king’s dale.  <strong>18</strong> And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.  <strong>19</strong> And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:  <strong>20</strong> And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.  <strong>21</strong> And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.  <strong>22</strong> And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,  <strong>23</strong> That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:  <strong>24</strong> Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.  <strong>1</strong> After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.  <strong>2</strong> And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?  <strong>3</strong> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.  <strong>4</strong> And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.  <strong>5</strong> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.  <strong>6</strong> And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.  <strong>7</strong> And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.  <strong>8</strong> And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.  <strong>10</strong> And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.  <strong>11</strong> And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.  <strong>12</strong> And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.  <strong>13</strong> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;  <strong>14</strong> And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.  <strong>15</strong> And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.  <strong>16</strong> But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.  <strong>18</strong> In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:  <strong>19</strong> The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,  <strong>20</strong> And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,  <strong>21</strong> And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.  <strong>1</strong> Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.  <strong>2</strong> And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.  <strong>3</strong> And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.  <strong>4</strong> And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.  <strong>5</strong> And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.  <strong>6</strong> But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.  <strong>7</strong> And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.  <strong>8</strong> And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.  <strong>9</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.  <strong>10</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.  <strong>11</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art  with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.  <strong>12</strong> And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.  <strong>13</strong> And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?  <strong>14</strong> Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is  between Kadesh and Bered.  <strong>15</strong> And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael.  <strong>16</strong> And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.  <strong>1</strong> And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.  <strong>2</strong> And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.  <strong>3</strong> And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,  <strong>4</strong> As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.  <strong>5</strong> Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.  <strong>6</strong> And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.  <strong>7</strong> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.  <strong>8</strong> And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.  <strong>9</strong> And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.  <strong>10</strong> This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.  <strong>11</strong> And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.  <strong>12</strong> And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.  <strong>13</strong> He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.  <strong>14</strong> And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.  <strong>15</strong> And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.  <strong>16</strong> And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.  <strong>17</strong> Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  <strong>18</strong> And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  <strong>19</strong> And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.  <strong>20</strong> And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.  <strong>21</strong> But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.  <strong>22</strong> And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.  <strong>23</strong> And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.  <strong>24</strong> And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <strong>25</strong> And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.  <strong>26</strong> In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.  <strong>27</strong> And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.  <strong>1</strong> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;  <strong>2</strong> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,  <strong>3</strong> And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:  <strong>4</strong> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:  <strong>5</strong> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.  <strong>6</strong> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.  <strong>7</strong> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.  <strong>8</strong> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.  <strong>9</strong> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.  <strong>10</strong> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it  in the tent door, which was behind him.  <strong>11</strong> Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  <strong>13</strong> And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?  <strong>14</strong> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.  <strong>15</strong> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.  <strong>16</strong> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.  <strong>17</strong> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;  <strong>18</strong> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  <strong>19</strong> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.  <strong>20</strong> And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;  <strong>21</strong> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.  <strong>22</strong> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?  <strong>24</strong> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are  therein?  <strong>25</strong> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  <strong>26</strong> And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:  <strong>28</strong> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.  <strong>29</strong> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.  <strong>30</strong> And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.  <strong>31</strong> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.  <strong>32</strong> And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.  <strong>33</strong> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.  <strong>1</strong> And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;  <strong>2</strong> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.  <strong>3</strong> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.  <strong>4</strong> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:  <strong>5</strong> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.  <strong>6</strong> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,  <strong>7</strong> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.  <strong>8</strong> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.  <strong>9</strong> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  <strong>10</strong> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  <strong>11</strong> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  <strong>12</strong> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:  <strong>13</strong> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.  <strong>14</strong> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.  <strong>15</strong> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  <strong>16</strong> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  <strong>18</strong> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:  <strong>19</strong> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:  <strong>20</strong> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.  <strong>21</strong> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.  <strong>22</strong> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  <strong>23</strong> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.  <strong>24</strong> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;  <strong>25</strong> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  <strong>28</strong> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  <strong>30</strong> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.  <strong>31</strong> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:  <strong>32</strong> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>33</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>34</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>35</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>36</strong> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.  <strong>37</strong> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.  <strong>38</strong> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.  <strong>1</strong> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.  <strong>2</strong> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  <strong>3</strong> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.  <strong>4</strong> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?  <strong>5</strong> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.  <strong>6</strong> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.  <strong>7</strong> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is  a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.  <strong>8</strong> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.  <strong>9</strong> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.  <strong>10</strong> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?  <strong>11</strong> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is  not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.  <strong>12</strong> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.  <strong>13</strong> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is  my brother.  <strong>14</strong> And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.  <strong>15</strong> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.  <strong>16</strong> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:  thus she was reproved.  <strong>17</strong> So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.  <strong>18</strong> For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.  <strong>1</strong> And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.  <strong>2</strong> For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.  <strong>3</strong> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.  <strong>4</strong> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.  <strong>5</strong> And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.  <strong>6</strong> And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me.  <strong>7</strong> And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.  <strong>8</strong> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.  <strong>9</strong> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.  <strong>10</strong> Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even  with Isaac.  <strong>11</strong> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.  <strong>12</strong> And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.  <strong>13</strong> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.  <strong>14</strong> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.  <strong>15</strong> And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.  <strong>16</strong> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.  <strong>17</strong> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.  <strong>18</strong> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.  <strong>19</strong> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.  <strong>20</strong> And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.  <strong>21</strong> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.  <strong>22</strong> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:  <strong>23</strong> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.  <strong>24</strong> And Abraham said, I will swear.  <strong>25</strong> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.  <strong>26</strong> And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.  <strong>28</strong> And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.  <strong>29</strong> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?  <strong>30</strong> And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.  <strong>31</strong> Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.  <strong>32</strong> Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.  <strong>33</strong> And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.  <strong>34</strong> And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.  <strong>2</strong> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.  <strong>3</strong> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.  <strong>4</strong> Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.  <strong>5</strong> And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you,  <strong>6</strong> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it  upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.  <strong>7</strong> And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  <strong>8</strong> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.  <strong>9</strong> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.  <strong>10</strong> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.  <strong>11</strong> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.  <strong>12</strong> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.  <strong>13</strong> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.  <strong>14</strong> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.  <strong>15</strong> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,  <strong>16</strong> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:  <strong>17</strong> That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;  <strong>18</strong> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.  <strong>19</strong> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.  <strong>20</strong> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;  <strong>21</strong> Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,  <strong>22</strong> And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.  <strong>23</strong> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.  <strong>24</strong> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.  <strong>1</strong> And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were  the years of the life of Sarah.  <strong>2</strong> And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.  <strong>3</strong> And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,  <strong>4</strong> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.  <strong>5</strong> And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,  <strong>6</strong> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.  <strong>7</strong> And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.  <strong>8</strong> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  <strong>9</strong> That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.  <strong>10</strong> And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even  of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,  <strong>11</strong> Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.  <strong>12</strong> And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.  <strong>13</strong> And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.  <strong>14</strong> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,  <strong>15</strong> My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.  <strong>16</strong> And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.  <strong>17</strong> And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were  in all the borders round about, were made sure  <strong>18</strong> Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.  <strong>19</strong> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.  <strong>20</strong> And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.  <strong>1</strong> And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.  <strong>2</strong> And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:  <strong>3</strong> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:  <strong>4</strong> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.  <strong>5</strong> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?  <strong>6</strong> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.  <strong>7</strong> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.  <strong>8</strong> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.  <strong>9</strong> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.  <strong>10</strong> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.  <strong>11</strong> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.  <strong>12</strong> And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.  <strong>13</strong> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:  <strong>14</strong> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that  thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.  <strong>16</strong> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.  <strong>17</strong> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.  <strong>18</strong> And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.  <strong>19</strong> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.  <strong>20</strong> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.  <strong>21</strong> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.  <strong>22</strong> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;  <strong>23</strong> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?  <strong>24</strong> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.  <strong>25</strong> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.  <strong>26</strong> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being  in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.  <strong>28</strong> And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these things.  <strong>29</strong> And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.  <strong>31</strong> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.  <strong>32</strong> And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that were with him.  <strong>33</strong> And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.  <strong>35</strong> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.  <strong>36</strong> And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.  <strong>37</strong> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:  <strong>38</strong> But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.  <strong>39</strong> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.  <strong>40</strong> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:  <strong>41</strong> Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.  <strong>42</strong> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;  <strong>43</strong> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;  <strong>44</strong> And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.  <strong>45</strong> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.  <strong>46</strong> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,  and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.  <strong>47</strong> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.  <strong>48</strong> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.  <strong>49</strong> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.  <strong>50</strong> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.  <strong>52</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.  <strong>53</strong> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.  <strong>54</strong> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.  <strong>55</strong> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.  <strong>56</strong> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.  <strong>57</strong> And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  <strong>58</strong> And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.  <strong>59</strong> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.  <strong>60</strong> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.  <strong>61</strong> And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.  <strong>62</strong> And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.  <strong>63</strong> And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.  <strong>64</strong> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.  <strong>65</strong> For she had said unto the servant, What man is  this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had  said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.  <strong>66</strong> And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.  <strong>67</strong> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death. <strong>1</strong> Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.  <strong>2</strong> And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.  <strong>3</strong> And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.  <strong>4</strong> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.  <strong>5</strong> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.  <strong>6</strong> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.  <strong>7</strong> And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.  <strong>8</strong> Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.  <strong>9</strong> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;  <strong>10</strong> The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.  <strong>12</strong> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:  <strong>13</strong> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,  <strong>14</strong> And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,  <strong>15</strong> Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:  <strong>16</strong> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.  <strong>17</strong> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.  <strong>18</strong> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.  <strong>19</strong> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:  <strong>20</strong> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.  <strong>21</strong> And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was  barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  <strong>22</strong> And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one  people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.  <strong>24</strong> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  <strong>25</strong> And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.  <strong>26</strong> And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.  <strong>27</strong> And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.  <strong>28</strong> And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.  <strong>29</strong> And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was  faint:  <strong>30</strong> And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.  <strong>31</strong> And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.  <strong>32</strong> And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?  <strong>33</strong> And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.  <strong>34</strong> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.  <strong>1</strong> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.  <strong>2</strong> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:  <strong>3</strong> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;  <strong>4</strong> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;  <strong>5</strong> Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.  <strong>6</strong> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:  <strong>7</strong> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.  <strong>9</strong> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is  thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.  <strong>10</strong> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.  <strong>11</strong> And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.  <strong>12</strong> Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.  <strong>13</strong> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:  <strong>14</strong> For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.  <strong>15</strong> For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.  <strong>16</strong> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.  <strong>17</strong> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.  <strong>18</strong> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.  <strong>19</strong> And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.  <strong>20</strong> And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.  <strong>21</strong> And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.  <strong>22</strong> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.  <strong>23</strong> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.  <strong>24</strong> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am  the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.  <strong>25</strong> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well.  <strong>26</strong> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.  <strong>27</strong> And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?  <strong>28</strong> And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;  <strong>29</strong> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.  <strong>30</strong> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.  <strong>31</strong> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.  <strong>32</strong> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.  <strong>33</strong> And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is  Beer-sheba unto this day.  <strong>34</strong> And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:  <strong>35</strong> Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.  <strong>2</strong> And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:  <strong>3</strong> Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;  <strong>4</strong> And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.  <strong>5</strong> And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.  <strong>6</strong> And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,  <strong>7</strong> Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.  <strong>8</strong> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.  <strong>9</strong> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:  <strong>10</strong> And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.  <strong>11</strong> And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:  <strong>12</strong> My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.  <strong>13</strong> And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.  <strong>14</strong> And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.  <strong>15</strong> And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:  <strong>16</strong> And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:  <strong>17</strong> And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.  <strong>18</strong> And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?  <strong>19</strong> And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.  <strong>20</strong> And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.  <strong>21</strong> And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.  <strong>22</strong> And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.  <strong>23</strong> And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.  <strong>24</strong> And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.  <strong>25</strong> And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.  <strong>26</strong> And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.  <strong>27</strong> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is  as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:  <strong>28</strong> Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:  <strong>29</strong> Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be  every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  <strong>31</strong> And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.  <strong>32</strong> And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.  <strong>33</strong> And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is  he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and  he shall be blessed.  <strong>34</strong> And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even  me also, O my father.  <strong>35</strong> And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.  <strong>36</strong> And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?  <strong>37</strong> And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  <strong>38</strong> And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.  <strong>39</strong> And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;  <strong>40</strong> And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.  <strong>41</strong> And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.  <strong>42</strong> And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.  <strong>43</strong> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;  <strong>44</strong> And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;  <strong>45</strong> Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that  which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?  <strong>46</strong> And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?  <strong>1</strong> And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.  <strong>2</strong> Arise, go to Padan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother’s father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother’s brother.  <strong>3</strong> And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;  <strong>4</strong> And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.  <strong>5</strong> And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.  <strong>6</strong> When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padan-aram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;  <strong>7</strong> And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padan-aram;  <strong>8</strong> And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father;  <strong>9</strong> Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.  <strong>10</strong> And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.  <strong>11</strong> And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.  <strong>12</strong> And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.  <strong>13</strong> And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;  <strong>14</strong> And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.  <strong>15</strong> And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.  <strong>16</strong> And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.  <strong>17</strong> And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.  <strong>18</strong> And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.  <strong>19</strong> And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first.  <strong>20</strong> And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,  <strong>21</strong> So that I come again to my father’s house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God:  <strong>22</strong> And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.  <strong>1</strong> Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.  <strong>2</strong> And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were  three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.  <strong>3</strong> And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in his place.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD had said to Abram, \"Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So Abram left, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD appeared to Abram and said, \"To your offspring I will give this land.\" So he built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, \"I know what a beautiful woman you are. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And when Pharaoh's officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram's wife Sarai. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> So Pharaoh summoned Abram. \"What have you done to me?\" he said. \"Why didn't you tell me she was your wife? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup>
