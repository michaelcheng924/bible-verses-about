","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The LORD spoke to Moses in the Tent of Meeting in the Desert of Sinai on the first day of the second month of the second year after the Israelites came out of Egypt. He said: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Take a census of the whole Israelite community by their clans and families, listing every man by name, one by one. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> You and Aaron are to number by their divisions all the men in Israel twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> One man from each tribe, each the head of his family, is to help you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> These are the names of the men who are to assist you: from Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> from Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> from Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab; <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> from Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> from Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon; <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> from the sons of Joseph: from Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; from Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur; <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> from Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni; <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> from Dan, Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> from Asher, Pagiel son of Ocran; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> from Gad, Eliasaph son of Deuel; <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> from Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> These were the men appointed from the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes. They were the heads of the clans of Israel. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Moses and Aaron took these men whose names had been given, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> and they called the whole community together on the first day of the second month. The people indicated their ancestry by their clans and families, and the men twenty years old or more were listed by name, one by one, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> as the LORD commanded Moses. And so he counted them in the Desert of Sinai: <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> From the descendants of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Reuben was 46,500. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the descendants of Simeon: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were counted and listed by name, one by one, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Simeon was 59,300. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> From the descendants of Gad: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Gad was 45,650. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> From the descendants of Judah: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Judah was 74,600. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> From the descendants of Issachar: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Issachar was 54,400. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> From the descendants of Zebulun: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Zebulun was 57,400. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> From the sons of Joseph: From the descendants of Ephraim: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Ephraim was 40,500. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> From the descendants of Manasseh: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Manasseh was 32,200. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> From the descendants of Benjamin: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Benjamin was 35,400. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> From the descendants of Dan: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Dan was 62,700. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> From the descendants of Asher: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Asher was 41,500. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> From the descendants of Naphtali: All the men twenty years old or more who were able to serve in the army were listed by name, according to the records of their clans and families. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The number from the tribe of Naphtali was 53,400. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> These were the men counted by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one representing his family. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel's army were counted according to their families. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The total number was 603,550. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The families of the tribe of Levi, however, were not counted along with the others. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The LORD had said to Moses: <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony-over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it.

He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.  <strong>10</strong> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  <strong>11</strong> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  <strong>12</strong> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;  <strong>13</strong> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  <strong>14</strong> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  <strong>15</strong> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,  <strong>16</strong> This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  <strong>17</strong> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  <strong>18</strong> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.  <strong>19</strong> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,  <strong>20</strong> By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;  <strong>21</strong> And having an high priest over the house of God;  <strong>22</strong> Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.  <strong>23</strong> Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)  <strong>24</strong> And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:  <strong>25</strong> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  <strong>26</strong> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  <strong>27</strong> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.  <strong>28</strong> He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:  <strong>29</strong> Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?  <strong>30</strong> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.  <strong>31</strong> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  <strong>32</strong> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  <strong>33</strong> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  <strong>34</strong> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.  <strong>35</strong> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  <strong>36</strong> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  <strong>37</strong> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  <strong>38</strong> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  <strong>39</strong> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.  <strong>1</strong> Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  <strong>2</strong> For by it the elders obtained a good report.  <strong>3</strong> Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  <strong>4</strong> By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.  <strong>5</strong> By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.  <strong>6</strong> But without faith it is impossible to please him:  for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that  he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  <strong>7</strong> By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.  <strong>8</strong> By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.  <strong>9</strong> By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:  <strong>10</strong> For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.  <strong>11</strong> Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.  <strong>13</strong> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.  <strong>14</strong> For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.  <strong>15</strong> And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.  <strong>16</strong> But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.  <strong>17</strong> By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,  <strong>18</strong> Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:  <strong>19</strong> Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.  <strong>20</strong> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.  <strong>21</strong> By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.  <strong>22</strong> By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.  <strong>23</strong> By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.  <strong>24</strong> By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;  <strong>25</strong> Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;  <strong>26</strong> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  <strong>27</strong> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  <strong>28</strong> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  <strong>29</strong> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land:  which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  <strong>30</strong> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  <strong>31</strong> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  <strong>32</strong> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:  <strong>33</strong> Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,  <strong>34</strong> Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.  <strong>35</strong> Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:  <strong>36</strong> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  <strong>37</strong> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  <strong>38</strong> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  <strong>39</strong> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  <strong>40</strong> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.  <strong>1</strong> Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,  <strong>2</strong> Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.  <strong>3</strong> For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.  <strong>4</strong> Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.  <strong>5</strong> And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:  <strong>6</strong> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  <strong>7</strong> If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?  <strong>8</strong> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.  <strong>9</strong> Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,  and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?  <strong>10</strong> For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.  <strong>11</strong> Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;  <strong>13</strong> And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.  <strong>14</strong> Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:  <strong>15</strong> Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;  <strong>16</strong> Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.  <strong>17</strong> For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.  <strong>18</strong> For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,  <strong>19</strong> And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which  voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:  <strong>20</strong> (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:  <strong>21</strong> And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:)  <strong>22</strong> But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,  <strong>23</strong> To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,  <strong>24</strong> And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.  <strong>25</strong> See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape,  if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:  <strong>26</strong> Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.  <strong>27</strong> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  <strong>28</strong> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:  <strong>29</strong> For our God is a consuming fire.  <strong>1</strong> Let brotherly love continue.  <strong>2</strong> Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.  <strong>3</strong> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.  <strong>4</strong> Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.  <strong>5</strong> Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  <strong>6</strong> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.  <strong>7</strong> Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.  <strong>8</strong> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.  <strong>9</strong> Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is  a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.  <strong>10</strong> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.  <strong>11</strong> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.  <strong>13</strong> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.  <strong>14</strong> For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.  <strong>15</strong> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.  <strong>16</strong> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.  <strong>17</strong> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.  <strong>18</strong> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.  <strong>19</strong> But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.  <strong>20</strong> Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,  <strong>21</strong> Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be  glory for ever and ever. Amen.  <strong>22</strong> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.  <strong>23</strong> Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.  <strong>24</strong> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.  <strong>25</strong> Grace be with you all. Amen.

For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: \"Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll--I have come to do your will, O God.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> First he said, \"Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them\" (although the law required them to be made). <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then he said, \"Here I am, I have come to do your will.\" He sets aside the first to establish the second. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool, "},{"_id":"6168d1c93b32607a097c1ad8","topicId":"6168d1c33b32607a097c1ac7","verse":"1 Corinthians 13:1-13","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p46013001_05-20\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v46013001-1\">13:1&nbsp;</b>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46013002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46013003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"p46013003_05-20\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46013004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46013005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>or rude.
