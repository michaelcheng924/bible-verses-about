No one was strong enough to subdue him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?

The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying.

And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher any more?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But they laughed at him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, \"Talitha koum!\" (which means, \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\" ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old).

Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Surely wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns, it sets the forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> By the wrath of the LORD Almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire; no one will spare his brother. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> On the right they will devour, but still be hungry; on the left they will eat, but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh; together they will turn against Judah.

This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, \"We have never seen anything like this!\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and \"sinners\" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the \"sinners\" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> On hearing this, Jesus said to them, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, \"How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment.
