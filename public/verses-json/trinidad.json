 <strong>10</strong> Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.  <strong>11</strong> This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.  <strong>12</strong> Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.  <strong>13</strong> Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.  <strong>14</strong> And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.  <strong>15</strong> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,  <strong>16</strong> Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.  <strong>17</strong> But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.  <strong>18</strong> And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.  <strong>19</strong> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  <strong>20</strong> For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  <strong>21</strong> So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men  glorified God for that which was done.  <strong>22</strong> For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.  <strong>23</strong> And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.  <strong>24</strong> And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:  <strong>25</strong> Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?  <strong>26</strong> The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.  <strong>27</strong> For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,  <strong>28</strong> For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.  <strong>29</strong> And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,  <strong>30</strong> By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.  <strong>31</strong> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.  <strong>32</strong> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.  <strong>33</strong> And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.  <strong>34</strong> Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,  <strong>35</strong> And laid them down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.  <strong>36</strong> And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,  <strong>37</strong> Having land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and the other men of the high priest's family. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: \"By what power or what name did you do this?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: \"Rulers and elders of the people! <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He is \"'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the capstone. ' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"What are we going to do with these men?\" they asked. \"Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle, and we cannot deny it. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But Peter and John replied, \"Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. \"Sovereign Lord,\" they said, \"you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: \"'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One. ' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement), <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.

Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.  <strong>9</strong> All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.  <strong>10</strong> And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.  <strong>11</strong> And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.  <strong>12</strong> And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.  <strong>13</strong> And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.  <strong>14</strong> He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.  <strong>15</strong> For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.  <strong>16</strong> And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:  <strong>17</strong> And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.  <strong>18</strong> And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.  <strong>19</strong> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.  <strong>20</strong> And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.  <strong>21</strong> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.  <strong>22</strong> And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.  <strong>23</strong> And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.  <strong>24</strong> And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.  <strong>25</strong> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.  <strong>26</strong> And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.  <strong>27</strong> And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.  <strong>28</strong> And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:  <strong>29</strong> And on the borders that were between the ledges were  lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was  a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.  <strong>30</strong> And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.  <strong>31</strong> And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.  <strong>32</strong> And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit.  <strong>33</strong> And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were  all molten.  <strong>34</strong> And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.  <strong>35</strong> And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.  <strong>36</strong> For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.  <strong>37</strong> After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.  <strong>38</strong> Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.  <strong>39</strong> And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.  <strong>40</strong> And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:  <strong>41</strong> The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;  <strong>42</strong> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even  two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;  <strong>43</strong> And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;  <strong>44</strong> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;  <strong>45</strong> And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of  bright brass.  <strong>46</strong> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.  <strong>47</strong> And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.  <strong>48</strong> And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,  <strong>49</strong> And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side,  and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,  <strong>50</strong> And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both  for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and  for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.  <strong>51</strong> So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns-forty-five beams, fifteen to a row. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and trimmed with a saw on their inner and outer faces. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits and some eight. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the LORD with its portico. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was a man of Tyre and a craftsman in bronze. Huram was highly skilled and experienced in all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits around, by line. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> A network of interwoven chains festooned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits high. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Below the rim, gourds encircled it-ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim-and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> He also made the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD: <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars); <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> the ten stands with their ten basins; <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> the Sea and the twelve bulls under it; <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of burnished bronze. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the LORD's temple: the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence; <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs; <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated-the silver and gold and the furnishings-and he placed them in the treasuries of the LORD's temple.

if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  <strong>22</strong> Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. <strong>23</strong>           Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.  <strong>24</strong> And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  <strong>25</strong> But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.  <strong>26</strong> The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>27</strong> Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.  <strong>28</strong> But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  <strong>29</strong> And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>30</strong> And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.  <strong>31</strong> So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.  <strong>32</strong> Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:  <strong>33</strong> Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  <strong>34</strong> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  <strong>35</strong> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He called a little child and had him stand among them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And he said: \"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come! <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What do you think?

If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, \"Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii.
