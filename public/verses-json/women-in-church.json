But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p46011016_06-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>When you come together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.</p>\n<p id=\"p46011022_06-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, <span class=\"woc\">“This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, <span class=\"woc\">“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</p>\n<p id=\"p46011026_06-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p>\n<p id=\"p46011032_06-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another—<b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46011034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment.

When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground- <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground-trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur.

I will make a helper suitable for him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The man said, \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman, 'for she was taken out of man.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
