Now the famine was severe in Samaria. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>So they divided the land between them to pass through it.

Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>And he said, “How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you.

If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal’s prophets are 450 men. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it.

And they limped around the altar that they had made. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018029_09-36\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, “Israel shall be your name,” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And he said, “Do it a second time.” And they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time.” And they did it a third time. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018035_09-36\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them.

And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel. And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018043-1\">43&nbsp;</b>And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.” And he went up and looked and said, “There is nothing.” And he said, “Go again,” seven times. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018044-1\">44&nbsp;</b>And at the seventh time he said, “Behold, a little cloud like a man’s hand is rising from the sea.” And he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018045-1\">45&nbsp;</b>And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, \"May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. \"I have had enough, LORD,\" he said. \"Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, \"Get up and eat.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, \"Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him: \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The LORD said, \"Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.\" Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, \"What are you doing here, Elijah?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He replied, \"I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The LORD said to him, \"Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel-all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. \"Let me kiss my father and mother good-by,\" he said, \"and then I will come with you.Go back,\" Elijah replied. \"What have I done to you?\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.

And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.  <strong>5</strong> But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.  <strong>7</strong> And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.  <strong>8</strong> So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were  in his city, dwelling with Naboth.  <strong>9</strong> And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:  <strong>10</strong> And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.  <strong>11</strong> And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.  <strong>12</strong> They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.  <strong>13</strong> And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.  <strong>14</strong> Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.  <strong>17</strong> And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  <strong>18</strong> Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it.  <strong>19</strong> And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.  <strong>20</strong> And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,  <strong>22</strong> And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.  <strong>23</strong> And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.  <strong>24</strong> Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.  <strong>25</strong> But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.  <strong>26</strong> And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.  <strong>28</strong> And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  <strong>29</strong> Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite.

In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Naboth replied, \"The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, \"I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.\" He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, \"Why are you so sullen? Why won't you eat?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He answered her, \"Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jezebel his wife said, \"Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I'll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city with him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> In those letters she wrote: \"Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, \"Naboth has cursed both God and the king.\" So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then they sent word to Jezebel: \"Naboth has been stoned and is dead.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, \"Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth's vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite: <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the LORD says: In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood-yes, yours!'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Ahab said to Elijah, \"So you have found me, my enemy!I have found you,\" he answered, \"because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> 'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel-slave or free. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"And also concerning Jezebel the LORD says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> (There was never a man like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, urged on by Jezebel his wife. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the LORD drove out before Israel.) <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me?

And there was a sore famine in Samaria.  <strong>3</strong> And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his  house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:  <strong>4</strong> For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  <strong>5</strong> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.  <strong>6</strong> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  <strong>7</strong> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  <strong>8</strong> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>9</strong> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  <strong>10</strong> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is  not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  <strong>11</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>12</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  <strong>13</strong> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <strong>14</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here:  and he shall slay me.  <strong>15</strong> And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.  <strong>16</strong> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.  <strong>20</strong> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.  <strong>21</strong> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.  <strong>23</strong> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it  on wood, and put no fire under:  <strong>24</strong> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.  <strong>25</strong> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.  <strong>26</strong> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.  <strong>28</strong> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  <strong>30</strong> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.  <strong>31</strong> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:  <strong>32</strong> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.  <strong>33</strong> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it  the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  <strong>35</strong> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that  I have done all these things at thy word.  <strong>37</strong> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.  <strong>38</strong> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.  <strong>39</strong> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.  <strong>40</strong> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.  <strong>41</strong> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.  <strong>42</strong> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,  <strong>43</strong> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.  <strong>44</strong> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.  <strong>45</strong> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.  <strong>46</strong> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: \"Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Ahab had said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, \"Is it really you, my lord Elijah?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What have I done wrong,\" asked Obadiah, \"that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Elijah said, \"As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he saw Elijah, he said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have not made trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Elijah went before the people and said, \"How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.\" But the people said nothing. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to them, \"I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire-he is God.\" Then all the people said, \"What you say is good.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. \"O Baal, answer us!\" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At noon Elijah began to taunt them. \"Shout louder!\" he said. \"Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come here to me.\" They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Your name shall be Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Do it again,\" he said, and they did it again. \"Do it a third time,\" he ordered, and they did it the third time. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, \"The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Elijah commanded them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!\" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Go and look toward the sea,\" he told his servant. And he went up and looked. \"There is nothing there,\" he said. Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The seventh time the servant reported, \"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" So Elijah said, \"Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
