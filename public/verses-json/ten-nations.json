So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  <strong>17</strong> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.  <strong>19</strong> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;  <strong>20</strong> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of  the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of  that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.  <strong>21</strong> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <strong>22</strong> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.  <strong>23</strong> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <strong>24</strong> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  <strong>25</strong> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.  <strong>26</strong> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  <strong>27</strong> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.  <strong>28</strong> Hitherto is the end of the matter.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\" "},{"_id":"616b4e87ede035c13f932642","topicId":"616b4e86ede035c13f932640","verse":"Revelation 17:1-18","votes":8,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p66017001_07-2\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v66017001-1\">17:1&nbsp;</b>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66017002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and with the wine of whose sexual immorality the dwellers on earth have become drunk.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66017003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66017004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66017005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: “Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth’s abominations.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66017006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.</p>\n<p id=\"p66017006_07-2\">When I saw her, I marveled greatly. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v66017007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>But the angel said to me, “Why do you marvel?

So they came and stood before the king.  <strong>3</strong> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.  <strong>4</strong> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.  <strong>5</strong> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.  <strong>6</strong> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.  <strong>7</strong> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.  <strong>8</strong> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.  <strong>9</strong> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but  one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.  <strong>10</strong> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is  no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.  <strong>11</strong> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.  <strong>12</strong> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.  <strong>14</strong> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:  <strong>15</strong> He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is  the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.  <strong>16</strong> Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.  <strong>17</strong> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:  <strong>18</strong> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.  <strong>19</strong> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:  <strong>21</strong> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:  <strong>22</strong> He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is  in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.  <strong>23</strong> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.  <strong>25</strong> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.  <strong>26</strong> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?  <strong>27</strong> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;  <strong>28</strong> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;  <strong>29</strong> As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.  <strong>30</strong> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any  wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.  <strong>31</strong> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was  terrible.  <strong>32</strong> This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,  <strong>33</strong> His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.  <strong>34</strong> Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces.  <strong>35</strong> Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.  <strong>36</strong> This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.  <strong>37</strong> Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.  <strong>38</strong> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.  <strong>39</strong> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.  <strong>40</strong> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.  <strong>41</strong> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.  <strong>42</strong> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.  <strong>43</strong> And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.  <strong>44</strong> And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.  <strong>45</strong> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.  <strong>46</strong> Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.  <strong>47</strong> The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,  that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.  <strong>48</strong> Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.  <strong>49</strong> Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat  in the gate of the king.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> he said to them, \"I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, \"O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The king replied to the astrologers, \"This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Once more they replied, \"Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the king answered, \"I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The astrologers answered the king, \"There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He asked the king's officer, \"Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?\" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and said: \"Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, \"Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, \"I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), \"Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Daniel replied, \"No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue-an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron-for iron breaks and smashes everything-and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands-a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. \"The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The king said to Daniel, \"Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
