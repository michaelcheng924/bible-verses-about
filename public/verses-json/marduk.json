It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, \"How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled-the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He said to me, \"It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there before me stood one who looked like a man. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai calling, \"Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of the vision.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As he came near the place where I was standing, I was terrified and fell prostrate. \"Son of man,\" he said to me, \"understand that the vision concerns the time of the end.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While he was speaking to me, I was in a deep sleep, with my face to the ground. Then he touched me and raised me to my feet. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He said: \"I am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath, because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes is the first king. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a stern-faced king, a master of intrigue, will arise. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty men and the holy people. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay ill for several days. Then I got up and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.

So they came and stood before the king.  <strong>3</strong> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.  <strong>4</strong> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.  <strong>5</strong> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.  <strong>6</strong> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.  <strong>7</strong> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.  <strong>8</strong> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.  <strong>9</strong> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but  one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.  <strong>10</strong> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is  no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.  <strong>11</strong> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.  <strong>12</strong> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.  <strong>14</strong> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:  <strong>15</strong> He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is  the decree so hasty from the king?

Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:  <strong>21</strong> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:  <strong>22</strong> He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is  in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.  <strong>23</strong> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.  <strong>25</strong> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.  <strong>26</strong> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?  <strong>27</strong> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;  <strong>28</strong> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> he said to them, \"I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, \"O king, live forever!

So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Once more they replied, \"Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the king answered, \"I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The astrologers answered the king, \"There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He asked the king's officer, \"Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?\" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and said: \"Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, \"Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, \"I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), \"Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Daniel replied, \"No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue-an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron-for iron breaks and smashes everything-and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands-a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. \"The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The king said to Daniel, \"Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
