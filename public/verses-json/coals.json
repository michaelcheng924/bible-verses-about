Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.  <strong>13</strong> Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand.

Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. <strong>46</strong> While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.  <strong>47</strong> Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  <strong>48</strong> But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?  <strong>49</strong> And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!  <strong>50</strong> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

How then can his kingdom stand? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out?

can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?  <strong>5</strong> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>6</strong> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  <strong>7</strong> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  <strong>8</strong> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  <strong>9</strong> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"615a7180b7283e0c141b510b","topicId":"615a717ab7283e0c141b50f6","verse":"John 1:1-51","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43001001_05-21\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v43001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>He was in the beginning with God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>In him was life, and the life was the light of men. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</p>\n<p id=\"p43001005_05-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.</p>\n<p id=\"p43001008_05-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>\n<p id=\"p43001013_05-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>(John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p43001018_11-21\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43001021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>And they asked him, “What then?

Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.  <strong>22</strong> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see.

And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Nephilim were on the earth in those days-and also afterward-when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So the LORD said, \"I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth-men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air-for I am grieved that I have made them.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So God said to Noah, \"I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark-you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
