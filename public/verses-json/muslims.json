God knoweth.  <strong>12</strong> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.  <strong>13</strong> For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.  <strong>14</strong> And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.  <strong>16</strong> I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.  <strong>17</strong> That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.  <strong>18</strong> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.  <strong>19</strong> For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.  <strong>20</strong> For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.  <strong>21</strong> I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak.

Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: \"The man who does these things will live by them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the righteousness that is by faith says: \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'\" (that is, to bring Christ down) <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"or 'Who will descend into the deep?'\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But what does it say? \"The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,\" that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> That if you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As the Scripture says, \"Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for, \"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, \"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, \"Lord, who has believed our message?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: \"Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, \"I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And Isaiah boldly says, \"I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But concerning Israel he says, \"All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.\" "},{"_id":"6168be883b32607a097c1325","topicId":"6168be863b32607a097c131f","verse":"Romans 7:6","votes":17,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p45007006_01-6\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45007006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>6</strong> But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.

It is  not good to have respect of persons in judgment.  <strong>24</strong> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:  <strong>25</strong> But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.  <strong>26</strong> Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.  <strong>27</strong> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.  <strong>28</strong> Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.  <strong>29</strong> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.  <strong>30</strong> I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;  <strong>31</strong> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.  <strong>32</strong> Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.  <strong>33</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>34</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.  <strong>1</strong> These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.  <strong>2</strong> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.  <strong>3</strong> The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.  <strong>4</strong> Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.  <strong>5</strong> Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.  <strong>6</strong> Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:  <strong>7</strong> For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.  <strong>8</strong> Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.  <strong>9</strong> Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:  <strong>10</strong> Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.  <strong>11</strong> A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.  <strong>12</strong> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.  <strong>13</strong> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.  <strong>14</strong> Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.  <strong>15</strong> By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when he stumbles, do not let your heart rejoice, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Fear the LORD and the king, my son, and do not join with the rebellious, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> for those two will send sudden destruction upon them, and who knows what calamities they can bring? Further Sayings of the Wise <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good: <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Whoever says to the guilty, \"You are innocent\"- peoples will curse him and nations denounce him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them.

It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  <strong>35</strong> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  <strong>36</strong> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  <strong>37</strong> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  <strong>38</strong> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  <strong>39</strong> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic. "}]}
