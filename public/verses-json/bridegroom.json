Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then one of the elders asked me, \"These in white robes--who are they, and where did they come from?\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I answered, \"Sir, you know.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And he said, \"These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
