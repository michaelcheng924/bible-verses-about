Thus were  their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.  <strong>5</strong> And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,  <strong>6</strong> Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.  <strong>7</strong> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were  the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.  <strong>8</strong> Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.  <strong>9</strong> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.  <strong>10</strong> These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.  <strong>11</strong> And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.  <strong>12</strong> She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.  <strong>13</strong> Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took  both one way,  <strong>14</strong> And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,  <strong>15</strong> Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:  <strong>16</strong> And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.  <strong>17</strong> And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.  <strong>18</strong> So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.  <strong>19</strong> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.  <strong>20</strong> For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  <strong>21</strong> Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;  <strong>23</strong> The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.  <strong>24</strong> And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.  <strong>25</strong> And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.  <strong>26</strong> They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.  <strong>27</strong> Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.  <strong>28</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:  <strong>29</strong> And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>30</strong> I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.  <strong>31</strong> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.  <strong>32</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.  <strong>33</strong> Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.  <strong>34</strong> Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>35</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>36</strong> The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;  <strong>37</strong> That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.  <strong>38</strong> Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.  <strong>39</strong> For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.  <strong>40</strong> And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,  <strong>41</strong> And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.  <strong>42</strong> And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.  <strong>43</strong> Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  <strong>44</strong> Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.  <strong>45</strong> And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.  <strong>46</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.  <strong>47</strong> And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.  <strong>48</strong> Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.  <strong>49</strong> And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.

In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians-warriors <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Therefore I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She too lusted after the Assyrians-governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword.

You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you naked and bare, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> have brought this upon you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"You will drink your sister's cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You will drink it and drain it dry; you will dash it to pieces and tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have forgotten me and thrust me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The LORD said to me: \"Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it.

So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.  <strong>15</strong> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.  <strong>16</strong> Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.  <strong>17</strong> And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?  <strong>18</strong> Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.  <strong>19</strong> Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.  <strong>20</strong> And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.  <strong>21</strong> So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.  <strong>22</strong> Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.  <strong>24</strong> Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither  the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.  <strong>25</strong> Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.  <strong>26</strong> But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.  <strong>27</strong> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>28</strong> Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.  <strong>29</strong> And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?  <strong>30</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.  <strong>31</strong> And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.  <strong>32</strong> Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, each of them will turn from his wicked way; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then Jeremiah told Baruch, \"I am restricted; I cannot go to the LORD's temple. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD, and each will turn from his wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD's temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD's temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> he went down to the secretary's room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, \"Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.\" So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> They said to him, \"Sit down, please, and read it to us.\" So Baruch read it to them. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, \"We must report all these words to the king.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then they asked Baruch, \"Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" Baruch replied, \"he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then the officials said to Baruch, \"You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe's knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, \"Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and animals from it?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them. "}]}
