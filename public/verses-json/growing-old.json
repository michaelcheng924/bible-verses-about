because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.  <strong>22</strong> The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish.  <strong>23</strong> And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.  <strong>24</strong> The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.  <strong>25</strong> The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.  <strong>26</strong> And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.  <strong>27</strong> The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed.  <strong>28</strong> The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart:  <strong>29</strong> And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.  <strong>30</strong> Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.  <strong>31</strong> Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.  <strong>32</strong> Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: and there shall be no might in thine hand.  <strong>33</strong> The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway:  <strong>34</strong> So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.  <strong>35</strong> The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head.  <strong>36</strong> The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.  <strong>37</strong> And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.  <strong>38</strong> Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.  <strong>39</strong> Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.  <strong>40</strong> Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.  <strong>41</strong> Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.  <strong>42</strong> All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.  <strong>43</strong> The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low.  <strong>44</strong> He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.  <strong>45</strong> Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:  <strong>46</strong> And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever.  <strong>47</strong> Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;  <strong>48</strong> Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.  <strong>49</strong> The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand;  <strong>50</strong> A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:  <strong>51</strong> And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either  corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.  <strong>52</strong> And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.  <strong>53</strong> And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee:  <strong>54</strong> So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:  <strong>55</strong> So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.  <strong>56</strong> The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,  <strong>57</strong> And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.  <strong>58</strong> If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;  <strong>59</strong> Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.  <strong>60</strong> Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.  <strong>61</strong> Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.  <strong>62</strong> And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God.  <strong>63</strong> And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.  <strong>64</strong> And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.  <strong>65</strong> And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:  <strong>66</strong> And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:  <strong>67</strong> In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.  <strong>68</strong> And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and ravish her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it.

They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children, <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The most gentle and sensitive woman among you-so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot-will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name-the LORD your God- <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods-gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> In the morning you will say, \"If only it were evening!\" and in the evening, \"If only it were morning!\"-because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.

 <strong>20</strong>             Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.  <strong>21</strong> Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.  <strong>22</strong> I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.  <strong>23</strong> My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.  <strong>24</strong> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.  <strong>1</strong> Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son.  <strong>2</strong> He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.  <strong>3</strong> The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.  <strong>4</strong> He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.  <strong>5</strong> They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.  <strong>6</strong> He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that  water the earth.  <strong>7</strong> In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.  <strong>8</strong> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.  <strong>9</strong> They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.  <strong>10</strong> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.  <strong>11</strong> Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.  <strong>12</strong> For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.  <strong>13</strong> He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.  <strong>14</strong> He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.  <strong>15</strong> And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.  <strong>16</strong> There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they  of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.  <strong>17</strong> His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.  <strong>18</strong> Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.  <strong>19</strong> And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.  <strong>20</strong> The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.  <strong>1</strong> Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.  <strong>2</strong> But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.  <strong>3</strong> For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  <strong>4</strong> For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.  <strong>5</strong> They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.  <strong>6</strong> Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.  <strong>7</strong> Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.  <strong>8</strong> They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.  <strong>9</strong> They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.  <strong>10</strong> Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup  are wrung out to them.  <strong>11</strong> And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?  <strong>12</strong> Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.  <strong>13</strong> Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.  <strong>14</strong> For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.  <strong>15</strong> If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against  the generation of thy children.  <strong>16</strong> When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;  <strong>17</strong> Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.  <strong>18</strong> Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.  <strong>19</strong> How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.  <strong>20</strong> As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.  <strong>21</strong> Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.  <strong>22</strong> So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.  <strong>23</strong> Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.  <strong>24</strong> Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.  <strong>25</strong> Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.  <strong>26</strong> My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.  <strong>27</strong> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.  <strong>28</strong> But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

<strong>2</strong> Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that  seek him with the whole heart.  <strong>3</strong> They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.  <strong>4</strong> Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.  <strong>5</strong> O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!  <strong>6</strong> Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.  <strong>7</strong> I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.  <strong>8</strong> I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not

wander from thy commandments.  <strong>11</strong> Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.  <strong>12</strong> Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>13</strong> With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.  <strong>14</strong> I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as  in all riches.  <strong>15</strong> I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.  <strong>16</strong> I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.  <strong>17</strong> Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.  <strong>18</strong> Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.  <strong>19</strong> I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy

from thy commandments.  <strong>22</strong> Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.  <strong>23</strong> Princes also did sit and speak against me: but  thy servant did

<strong>26</strong> I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>27</strong> Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.  <strong>28</strong> My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.  <strong>29</strong> Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.  <strong>30</strong> I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. <strong>31</strong> I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.  <strong>32</strong> I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.  <strong>33</strong> Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.  <strong>34</strong> Give me

Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.  <strong>37</strong> Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.  <strong>38</strong> Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.  <strong>39</strong> Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are  good.  <strong>40</strong> Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.  <strong>41</strong> Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.  <strong>42</strong> So shall I have wherewith to answer him

meditate in thy statutes.  <strong>49</strong> Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.  <strong>50</strong> This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.  <strong>51</strong> The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.  <strong>52</strong> I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.  <strong>53</strong> Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.  <strong>54</strong> Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.  <strong>55</strong> I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.  <strong>56</strong> This I had, because I kept thy precepts.  <strong>57</strong>             Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.  <strong>58</strong> I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.  <strong>59</strong> I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.  <strong>60</strong> I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.  <strong>61</strong> The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.  <strong>62</strong> At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>63</strong> I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.  <strong>64</strong> The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.  <strong>65</strong> Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>66</strong> Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.  <strong>67</strong> Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.  <strong>68</strong> Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.  <strong>69</strong> The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.  <strong>70</strong> Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.  <strong>71</strong>             It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.  <strong>72</strong> The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.  <strong>73</strong> Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.  <strong>74</strong> They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.  <strong>75</strong> I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.  <strong>76</strong> Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.  <strong>77</strong> Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.  <strong>78</strong> Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.  <strong>79</strong> Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.  <strong>80</strong> Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.  <strong>81</strong> My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.  <strong>82</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?  <strong>83</strong> For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.  <strong>84</strong> How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?  <strong>85</strong> The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.  <strong>86</strong> All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.  <strong>87</strong> They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.  <strong>88</strong> Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.  <strong>89</strong> For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.  <strong>90</strong> Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.  <strong>91</strong> They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.  <strong>92</strong> Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.  <strong>93</strong> I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.  <strong>94</strong> I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.  <strong>95</strong> The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.  <strong>96</strong> I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.  <strong>97</strong> O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.  <strong>98</strong> Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.  <strong>99</strong> I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.  <strong>100</strong> I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.  <strong>101</strong> I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.  <strong>102</strong> I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.  <strong>103</strong> How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!  <strong>104</strong> Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.  <strong>105</strong> Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.  <strong>106</strong> I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.  <strong>107</strong> I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.  <strong>108</strong> Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.  <strong>109</strong> My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.  <strong>110</strong> The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.  <strong>111</strong> Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.  <strong>112</strong> I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.  <strong>113</strong> I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.  <strong>114</strong> Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.  <strong>115</strong> Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.  <strong>116</strong> Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.  <strong>117</strong> Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.  <strong>118</strong> Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.  <strong>119</strong> Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.  <strong>120</strong> My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.  <strong>121</strong> I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.  <strong>122</strong> Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.  <strong>123</strong> Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.  <strong>124</strong> Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>125</strong> I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.  <strong>126</strong>             It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for  they have made void thy law.  <strong>127</strong> Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.  <strong>128</strong> Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning  all things to be right; and I hate every false way.  <strong>129</strong> Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.  <strong>130</strong> The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.  <strong>131</strong> I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.  <strong>132</strong> Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.  <strong>133</strong> Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.  <strong>134</strong> Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.  <strong>135</strong> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.  <strong>136</strong> Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.  <strong>137</strong> Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.  <strong>138</strong> Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.  <strong>139</strong> My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.  <strong>140</strong> Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.  <strong>141</strong> I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.  <strong>142</strong> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.  <strong>143</strong> Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.  <strong>144</strong> The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.  <strong>145</strong> I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes.  <strong>146</strong> I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.  <strong>147</strong> I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.  <strong>148</strong> Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.  <strong>149</strong> Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment.  <strong>150</strong> They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.  <strong>151</strong> Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are  truth.  <strong>152</strong> Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.  <strong>153</strong> Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.  <strong>154</strong> Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.  <strong>155</strong> Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.  <strong>156</strong> Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments.  <strong>157</strong> Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet  do I not decline from thy testimonies.  <strong>158</strong> I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.  <strong>159</strong> Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness.  <strong>160</strong> Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.  <strong>161</strong> Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.  <strong>162</strong> I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.  <strong>163</strong> I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.  <strong>164</strong> Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.  <strong>165</strong> Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.  <strong>166</strong> LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.  <strong>167</strong> My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.  <strong>168</strong> I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.  <strong>169</strong> Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word.  <strong>170</strong> Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.  <strong>171</strong> My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.  <strong>172</strong> My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are  righteousness.  <strong>173</strong> Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.  <strong>174</strong> I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is  my delight.  <strong>175</strong> Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.  <strong>176</strong> I have gone

He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The king said to Barzillai, \"Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But Barzillai answered the king, \"How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of men and women singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever pleases you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The king said, \"Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever pleases you. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and gave him his blessing, and Barzillai returned to his home.
