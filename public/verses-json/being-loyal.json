Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.  <strong>33</strong> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.  <strong>34</strong> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.  <strong>35</strong> This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.  <strong>36</strong> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.  <strong>37</strong> This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.  <strong>38</strong> This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:  <strong>39</strong> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,  <strong>40</strong> Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for  this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.  <strong>41</strong> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.  <strong>42</strong> Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?  <strong>43</strong> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.  <strong>44</strong> Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.  <strong>45</strong> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;  <strong>46</strong> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.  <strong>47</strong> But Solomon built him an house.  <strong>48</strong> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,  <strong>49</strong> Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?  <strong>50</strong> Hath not my hand made all these things?  <strong>51</strong> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.  <strong>52</strong> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:  <strong>53</strong> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.  <strong>54</strong> When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.  <strong>55</strong> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,  <strong>56</strong> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.  <strong>57</strong> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,  <strong>58</strong> And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.  <strong>59</strong> And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.  <strong>60</strong> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the high priest asked him, \"Are these charges true?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> To this he replied: \"Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> 'Leave your country and your people,' God said, 'and go to the land I will show you.' <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> God spoke to him in this way: 'Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt; so he made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our fathers could not find food. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our fathers died. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then another king, who knew nothing about Joseph, became ruler of Egypt. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for in his father's house. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?' <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 'Who made you ruler and judge over us? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord's voice: <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.' Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He led them out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"This is that Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will send you a prophet like me from your own people.' <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They told Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt--we don't know what has happened to him!' <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hands had made. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> But God turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: \"'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert, O house of Israel? <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> You have lifted up the shrine of Molech and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile' beyond Babylon. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the desert. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Having received the tabernacle, our fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David, <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> who enjoyed God's favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> But it was Solomon who built the house for him. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"However, the Most High does not live in houses made by men. As the prophet says: <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be? <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Has not my hand made all these things?' <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit! <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him-- <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> \"Look,\" he said, \"I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.\" <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then he fell on his knees and cried out, \"Lord, do not hold this sin against them.\" When he had said this, he fell asleep.

Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Lord, are you going to wash my feet?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"No,\" said Peter, \"you shall never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered, \"Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then, Lord,\" Simon Peter replied, \"not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. \"Do you understand what I have done for you?\" he asked them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen.

And it was night. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> When he was gone, Jesus said, \"Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"My children, I will be with you only a little longer.

I will lay down my life for you.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then Jesus answered, \"Will you really lay down your life for me?

 <strong>20</strong> But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:  <strong>21</strong> For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.  <strong>22</strong> And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.  <strong>23</strong> Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.  <strong>24</strong> For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.  <strong>25</strong> Behold, I have told you before.  <strong>26</strong> Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.  <strong>27</strong> For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  <strong>28</strong> For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together. <strong>29</strong>           Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:  <strong>30</strong> And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  <strong>31</strong> And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  <strong>32</strong> Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:  <strong>33</strong> So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.  <strong>34</strong> Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.  <strong>35</strong> Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.  <strong>36</strong>           But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.  <strong>37</strong> But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  <strong>38</strong> For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,  <strong>39</strong> And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.  <strong>40</strong> Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.  <strong>41</strong> Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. <strong>42</strong>           Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.  <strong>43</strong> But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.  <strong>44</strong> Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.  <strong>45</strong> Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  <strong>46</strong> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  <strong>47</strong> Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.  <strong>48</strong> But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming;  <strong>49</strong> And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;  <strong>50</strong> The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,  <strong>51</strong> And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Do you see all these things?\" he asked. \"I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. \"Tell us,\" they said, \"when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus answered: \"Watch out that no one deceives you. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ, 'and will deceive many. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All these are the beginning of birth pains. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel--let the reader understand-- <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect--if that were possible. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> See, I have told you ahead of time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Immediately after the distress of those days \"'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.  <strong>8</strong> Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:  <strong>9</strong> But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.  <strong>10</strong> And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.  <strong>11</strong> And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto  magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:  <strong>12</strong> For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say. <strong>13</strong> And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.  <strong>14</strong> And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?  <strong>15</strong> And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.  <strong>16</strong> And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:  <strong>17</strong> And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?  <strong>18</strong> And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.  <strong>19</strong> And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.  <strong>20</strong> But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?  <strong>21</strong> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. <strong>22</strong> And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.  <strong>23</strong> The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.  <strong>24</strong> Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?  <strong>25</strong> And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?  <strong>26</strong> If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?  <strong>27</strong> Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <strong>28</strong> If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?  <strong>29</strong> And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.  <strong>30</strong> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. <strong>31</strong>           But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>32</strong> Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.  <strong>33</strong> Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.  <strong>34</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>35</strong> Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;  <strong>36</strong> And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.  <strong>37</strong> Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.  <strong>38</strong> And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.  <strong>39</strong> And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.  <strong>40</strong> Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. <strong>41</strong> Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?  <strong>42</strong> And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?  <strong>43</strong> Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.  <strong>44</strong> Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.  <strong>45</strong> But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;  <strong>46</strong> The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.  <strong>47</strong> And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.  <strong>48</strong> But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. <strong>49</strong>           I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?  <strong>50</strong> But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!  <strong>51</strong> Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:  <strong>52</strong> For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.  <strong>53</strong> The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. <strong>54</strong>           And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.  <strong>55</strong> And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass.  <strong>56</strong> Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?  <strong>57</strong> Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?  <strong>58</strong>           When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.  <strong>59</strong> I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: \"Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Someone in the crowd said to him, \"Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then he said to them, \"Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he told them this parable: \"The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\"' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Peter asked, \"Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The Lord answered, \"Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> \"I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed! <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> He said to the crowd: \"When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Hypocrites!

<strong>2</strong> Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.  <strong>3</strong> For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me.  <strong>4</strong> Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.  <strong>5</strong> Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.  <strong>6</strong> I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.  <strong>7</strong> I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;  <strong>8</strong> And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.  <strong>9</strong> Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.  <strong>10</strong> For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.  <strong>11</strong> I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.  <strong>12</strong> I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.  <strong>13</strong> For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.  <strong>14</strong> But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.  <strong>15</strong> My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.  <strong>16</strong> Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake.  <strong>17</strong> Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.  <strong>18</strong> Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.  <strong>19</strong>             Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!  <strong>20</strong> Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.  <strong>21</strong> Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.  <strong>22</strong> For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.  <strong>23</strong> O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.  <strong>24</strong> Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
