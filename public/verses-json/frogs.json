And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> We must take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Pharaoh said, \"I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the desert, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Moses answered, \"As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only be sure that Pharaoh does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and the LORD did what Moses asked: The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
