lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.  <strong>10</strong> And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.  <strong>11</strong> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.  <strong>12</strong> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.  <strong>13</strong> Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh. <strong>14</strong>           For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.  <strong>15</strong> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.  <strong>16</strong> Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.  <strong>17</strong> And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.  <strong>18</strong> But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.  <strong>19</strong> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.  <strong>20</strong> And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.  <strong>21</strong> His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  <strong>22</strong> He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.  <strong>23</strong> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.  <strong>24</strong> Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:  <strong>25</strong> And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.  <strong>26</strong> His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:  <strong>27</strong> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.  <strong>28</strong> Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.  <strong>29</strong> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.  <strong>30</strong> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <strong>31</strong>           When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:  <strong>32</strong> And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:  <strong>33</strong> And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.  <strong>34</strong> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:  <strong>35</strong> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:  <strong>36</strong> Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.  <strong>37</strong> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee  drink?  <strong>38</strong> When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  <strong>39</strong> Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  <strong>40</strong> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.  <strong>41</strong> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:  <strong>42</strong> For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:  <strong>43</strong> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.  <strong>44</strong> Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?  <strong>45</strong> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.  <strong>46</strong> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Five of them were foolish and five were wise. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom!

Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.' <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived.

See, here is what belongs to you.' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant!
