But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may seeit.  <strong>16</strong> And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.  <strong>18</strong> Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,  <strong>19</strong> Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  <strong>20</strong> Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.  <strong>21</strong> And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.  <strong>22</strong> And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.  <strong>23</strong> In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.  <strong>24</strong> And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?  <strong>25</strong> For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.  <strong>26</strong> And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am  the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  <strong>27</strong> He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err. <strong>28</strong> And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:  <strong>30</strong> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.  <strong>31</strong> And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.  <strong>32</strong> And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:  <strong>33</strong> And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.  <strong>34</strong> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question.  <strong>35</strong> And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?  <strong>36</strong> For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.  <strong>37</strong> David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,  <strong>39</strong> And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:  <strong>40</strong> Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation. <strong>41</strong> And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.  <strong>42</strong> And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.  <strong>43</strong> And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:  <strong>44</strong> For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They came to him and said, \"Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

You are badly mistaken!\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \"Of all the commandments, which is the most important?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"The most important one,\" answered Jesus, \"is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Well said, teacher,\" the man replied. \"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, \"How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\"' <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?\" The large crowd listened to him with delight. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> As he taught, Jesus said, \"Watch out for the teachers of the law.

<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a

weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with
