How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you- <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them; <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm.\" ","modified":"2022-09-02T03:44:08.243Z"},{"_id":"6168c9c33b32607a097c16cf","topicId":"6168c9bc3b32607a097c16b8","verse":"2 Timothy 3:1-5","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p55003001_06-23\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v55003001-1\">3:1&nbsp;</b>But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v55003002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v55003003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v55003004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v55003005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power.
