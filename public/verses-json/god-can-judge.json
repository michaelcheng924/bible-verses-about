Amen.  <strong>6</strong> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:  <strong>7</strong> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.  <strong>8</strong> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are  not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.  <strong>9</strong> For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.  <strong>10</strong> And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;  <strong>11</strong> (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)  <strong>12</strong> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.  <strong>13</strong> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.  <strong>14</strong> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.  <strong>15</strong> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  <strong>16</strong> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.  <strong>17</strong> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.  <strong>18</strong> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?  <strong>20</strong> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?  <strong>21</strong> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  <strong>22</strong> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:  <strong>23</strong> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,  <strong>24</strong> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?  <strong>25</strong> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.  <strong>26</strong> And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.  <strong>27</strong> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:  <strong>28</strong> For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.  <strong>30</strong> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.  <strong>31</strong> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  <strong>33</strong> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit-- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this was how the promise was stated: \"At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand: <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> not by works but by him who calls--she was told, \"The older will serve the younger.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Just as it is written: \"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For he says to Moses, \"I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: \"I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> One of you will say to me: \"Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? \"Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory-- <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As he says in Hosea: \"I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one,\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and, \"It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: \"Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> It is just as Isaiah said previously: \"Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the \"stumbling stone.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> As it is written: \"See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" "},{"_id":"616230699b02b3054ca4f9af","topicId":"616230689b02b3054ca4f9ad","verse":"Romans 5:12","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p45005012_07-2\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45005012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>12</strong> Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:  ","niv":"<sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--"},{"_id":"6162306a9b02b3054ca4f9b0","topicId":"616230689b02b3054ca4f9ad","verse":"Ephesians 1:11","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p49001011_01-3\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v49001011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>11</strong> In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:  ","niv":"<sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,"},{"_id":"6162306a9b02b3054ca4f9b1","topicId":"616230689b02b3054ca4f9ad","verse":"1 Corinthians 10:1-33","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p46010001_04-5\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v46010001-1\">10:1&nbsp;</b>For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46010002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46010003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>and all ate the same spiritual food, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46010004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>and all drank the same spiritual drink.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They all ate the same spiritual food <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered over the desert. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: \"The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did--and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> We should not test the Lord, as some of them did--and were killed by snakes. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And do not grumble, as some of them did--and were killed by the destroying angel. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Consider the people of Israel: Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is beneficial. \"Everything is permissible\"--but not everything is constructive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> for, \"The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if anyone says to you, \"This has been offered in sacrifice,\" then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake-- <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God-- <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
