Why not rather be defrauded? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v46006008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>But you yourselves wrong and defraud—even your own brothers!</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?  <strong>2</strong> Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?  <strong>3</strong> Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?  <strong>4</strong> If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.  <strong>5</strong> I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?  <strong>6</strong> But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.  <strong>7</strong> Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?  <strong>8</strong> Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints? <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life! <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church! <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But instead, one brother goes to law against another--and this in front of unbelievers! <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers. "}]}
