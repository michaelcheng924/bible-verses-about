<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with

me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I

And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  <strong>3</strong> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  <strong>4</strong> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  <strong>5</strong> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  <strong>6</strong> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  <strong>7</strong> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were  under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  <strong>8</strong> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  <strong>9</strong> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  <strong>10</strong> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>11</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>12</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>13</strong> And the evening and the morning were the third day.  <strong>14</strong> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  <strong>15</strong> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>16</strong> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  <strong>17</strong> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  <strong>18</strong> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>19</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  <strong>20</strong> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  <strong>21</strong> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>22</strong> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  <strong>23</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  <strong>24</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  <strong>25</strong> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>26</strong> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  <strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  <strong>28</strong> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  <strong>30</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  <strong>31</strong> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was  very good.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God called the expanse \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.
