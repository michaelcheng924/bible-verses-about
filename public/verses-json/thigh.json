Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)  <strong>7</strong> Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)  <strong>8</strong> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;  <strong>9</strong> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  <strong>10</strong> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  <strong>11</strong> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  <strong>12</strong> For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  <strong>13</strong> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>14</strong> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  <strong>15</strong> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  <strong>16</strong> But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  <strong>17</strong> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  <strong>18</strong> But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.  <strong>19</strong> But I say, Did not Israel know?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: \"The man who does these things will live by them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the righteousness that is by faith says: \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'\" (that is, to bring Christ down) <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"or 'Who will descend into the deep?'\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But what does it say? \"The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,\" that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> That if you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As the Scripture says, \"Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for, \"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, \"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.

Of course they did: \"Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, \"I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And Isaiah boldly says, \"I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But concerning Israel he says, \"All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.\" "},{"_id":"616c916e16dfdfefa2036670","topicId":"616c916616dfdfefa2036659","verse":"Romans 9:1-33","votes":1,"__v":0,"kjv":"<strong>1</strong> I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,  <strong>2</strong> That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.  <strong>3</strong> For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:  <strong>4</strong> Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;  <strong>5</strong> Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.  <strong>6</strong> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:  <strong>7</strong> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.  <strong>8</strong> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are  not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.  <strong>9</strong> For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.  <strong>10</strong> And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;  <strong>11</strong> (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)  <strong>12</strong> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.  <strong>13</strong> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.  <strong>14</strong> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.  <strong>15</strong> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  <strong>16</strong> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.  <strong>17</strong> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.  <strong>18</strong> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?  <strong>20</strong> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?  <strong>21</strong> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  <strong>22</strong> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:  <strong>23</strong> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,  <strong>24</strong> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?  <strong>25</strong> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.  <strong>26</strong> And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.  <strong>27</strong> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:  <strong>28</strong> For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.  <strong>30</strong> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.  <strong>31</strong> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  <strong>33</strong> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit-- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this was how the promise was stated: \"At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand: <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> not by works but by him who calls--she was told, \"The older will serve the younger.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Just as it is written: \"Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For he says to Moses, \"I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: \"I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> One of you will say to me: \"Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? \"Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction? <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory-- <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As he says in Hosea: \"I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one,\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and, \"It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: \"Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> It is just as Isaiah said previously: \"Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the \"stumbling stone.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> As it is written: \"See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" "},{"_id":"616c916e16dfdfefa2036671","topicId":"616c916616dfdfefa2036659","verse":"Romans 5:9","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p45005009_01-27\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45005009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>9</strong> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.
