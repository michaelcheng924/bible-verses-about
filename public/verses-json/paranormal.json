He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Samuel said, \"Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors-to David. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The LORD will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, \"Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He refused and said, \"I will not eat.\" But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.
