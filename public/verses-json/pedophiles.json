These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;  <strong>19</strong> I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.  <strong>20</strong> Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.  <strong>21</strong> And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.  <strong>22</strong> Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.  <strong>23</strong> And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.  <strong>24</strong> But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.  <strong>25</strong> But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.  <strong>26</strong> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:  <strong>27</strong> And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.  <strong>28</strong> And I will give him the morning star.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <strong>1</strong>           And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.  <strong>2</strong> Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.  <strong>3</strong> Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.  <strong>4</strong> Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.  <strong>5</strong> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.  <strong>6</strong> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <strong>7</strong>           And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;  <strong>8</strong> I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.  <strong>10</strong> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.  <strong>12</strong> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him  my new name.  <strong>13</strong> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <strong>14</strong>           And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;  <strong>15</strong> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.  <strong>16</strong> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.  <strong>17</strong> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:  <strong>18</strong> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that  the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.  <strong>19</strong> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.  <strong>20</strong> Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.  <strong>21</strong> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.  <strong>22</strong> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.

 <strong>2</strong> And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them,  <strong>3</strong> And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>4</strong> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>5</strong> And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.  <strong>6</strong> But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. <strong>7</strong>           Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  <strong>8</strong> Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.  <strong>9</strong> And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  <strong>10</strong> Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.  <strong>12</strong> How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  <strong>22</strong> Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. <strong>23</strong>           Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.  <strong>24</strong> And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  <strong>25</strong> But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.  <strong>26</strong> The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>27</strong> Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.  <strong>28</strong> But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.  <strong>29</strong> And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.  <strong>30</strong> And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.  <strong>31</strong> So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.  <strong>32</strong> Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:  <strong>33</strong> Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  <strong>34</strong> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  <strong>35</strong> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;  <strong>2</strong> And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.  <strong>3</strong> The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?  <strong>4</strong> And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,  <strong>5</strong> And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?  <strong>6</strong> Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.  <strong>7</strong> They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?  <strong>8</strong> He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.  <strong>9</strong> And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.  <strong>10</strong> His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.  <strong>11</strong> But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.  <strong>12</strong> For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their  mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. <strong>13</strong> Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.  <strong>14</strong> But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>15</strong> And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.  <strong>16</strong> And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?  <strong>17</strong> And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is  none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.  <strong>18</strong> He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,  <strong>19</strong> Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <strong>20</strong> The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?  <strong>21</strong> Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and  sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.  <strong>22</strong> But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.  <strong>23</strong> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>24</strong> And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>25</strong> When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?  <strong>26</strong> But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. <strong>27</strong> Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?  <strong>28</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  <strong>29</strong> And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.  <strong>30</strong> But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He called a little child and had him stand among them. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And he said: \"I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come! <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
