I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.  <strong>16</strong> Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?  <strong>17</strong> For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.  <strong>18</strong> I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:  <strong>19</strong> Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.  <strong>20</strong> Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.  <strong>21</strong> In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.  <strong>22</strong> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.  <strong>23</strong> If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?  <strong>24</strong> But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:  <strong>25</strong> And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.  <strong>26</strong> How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.  <strong>27</strong> If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be  by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.  <strong>28</strong> But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.  <strong>29</strong> Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.  <strong>30</strong> If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.  <strong>31</strong> For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.  <strong>32</strong> And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.  <strong>33</strong> For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.  <strong>34</strong> Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.  <strong>35</strong> And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.  <strong>36</strong> What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?  <strong>37</strong> If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.  <strong>38</strong> But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.  <strong>39</strong> Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.  <strong>40</strong> Let all things be done decently and in order.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say \"Amen\" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> In the Law it is written: \"Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me,\" says the Lord. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, \"God is really among you!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.

You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> On that day there will be no light, no cold or frost. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> It will be a unique day, without daytime or nighttime-a day known to the LORD. When evening comes, there will be light. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea, in summer and in winter. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The LORD will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one LORD, and his name the only name. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up and remain in its place, from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This is the plague with which the LORD will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> On that day men will be stricken by the LORD with great panic. Each man will seize the hand of another, and they will attack each other. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected-great quantities of gold and silver and clothing. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, they will have no rain. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The LORD will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> On that dayHOLY TO THE LORD will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the LORD's house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the LORD Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them. And on that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD Almighty.
