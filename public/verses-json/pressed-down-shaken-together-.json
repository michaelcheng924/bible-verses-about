And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.  <strong>11</strong> And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.  <strong>12</strong> And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.  <strong>13</strong> And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;  <strong>14</strong> Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,  <strong>15</strong> Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called Zelotes,  <strong>16</strong> And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also was the traitor.  <strong>17</strong> And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;  <strong>18</strong> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.  <strong>19</strong> And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all.  <strong>20</strong> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.  <strong>21</strong> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  <strong>22</strong> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake.  <strong>23</strong> Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.  <strong>24</strong> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.  <strong>25</strong> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger.

Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He also told them this parable: \"Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.\" "},{"_id":"6169851bbda5ba8d737088c3","topicId":"61698515bda5ba8d737088b0","verse":"2 Corinthians 9:7","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p47009007_01-19\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v47009007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>7</strong> Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give;  not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.
