He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman's wife. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> She said to her mistress, \"If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"By all means, go,\" the king of Aram replied. \"I will send a letter to the king of Israel.\" So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The letter that he took to the king of Israel read: \"With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, \"Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!\" "},{"_id":"6159150f2053ce65432d86e1","topicId":"6159150a2053ce65432d86d2","verse":"Psalm 23:1-6","votes":15,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<h4 id=\"p19023001_06-15\" class=\"psalm-title\">A Psalm of David.</h4>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023001_06-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v19023001-1\">23:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-15\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes me lie down in green pastures.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-15\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me beside still waters.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-15\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He restores my soul.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-15\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me in paths of righteousness</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his name’s sake.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023004_06-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will fear no evil,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-15\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are with me;</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your rod and your staff,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they comfort me.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023005_06-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You prepare a table before me</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of my enemies;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-15\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;you anoint my head with oil;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cup overflows.</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-15\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of my life,</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-15\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-15\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forever.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  <strong>2</strong> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  <strong>3</strong> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  <strong>4</strong> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  <strong>5</strong> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  <strong>6</strong> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
