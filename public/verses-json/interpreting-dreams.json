It may be that then your prosperity will continue.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Twelve months later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> he said, \"Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven, \"This is what is decreed for you, King Nebuchadnezzar: Your royal authority has been taken from you. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like cattle.

He was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle. His body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored.

His dominion is an eternal dominion; his kingdom endures from generation to generation. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> All the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand or say to him: \"What have you done?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the same time that my sanity was restored, my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my throne and became even greater than before.

Thou art this head of gold.  <strong>39</strong> And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.  <strong>40</strong> And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.  <strong>41</strong> And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.  <strong>42</strong> And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.  <strong>43</strong> And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.  <strong>44</strong> And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.  <strong>45</strong> Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.  <strong>46</strong> Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.  <strong>47</strong> The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,  that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldst reveal this secret.  <strong>48</strong> Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.  <strong>49</strong> Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat  in the gate of the king.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams; his mind was troubled and he could not sleep. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So the king summoned the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed. When they came in and stood before the king, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> he said to them, \"I have had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means. \" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic, \"O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The king replied to the astrologers, \"This is what I have firmly decided: If you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it, I will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But if you tell me the dream and explain it, you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor. So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Once more they replied, \"Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the king answered, \"I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you. You have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things, hoping the situation will change. So then, tell me the dream, and I will know that you can interpret it for me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The astrologers answered the king, \"There is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks! No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He asked the king's officer, \"Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?\" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and said: \"Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, \"Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, \"I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), \"Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Daniel replied, \"No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue-an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"After you, another kingdom will rise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron-for iron breaks and smashes everything-and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands-a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces. \"The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The king said to Daniel, \"Surely your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to reveal this mystery.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Moreover, at Daniel's request the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained at the royal court.
