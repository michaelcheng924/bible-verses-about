He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
