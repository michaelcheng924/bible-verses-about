","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The great dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: \"Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring--those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

and he called them.  <strong>22</strong> And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.  <strong>23</strong> And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.  <strong>24</strong> And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.  <strong>25</strong> And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from  Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The tempter came to him and said, \"If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"If you are the Son of God,\" he said, \"throw yourself down. For it is written: \"'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"All this I will give you,\" he said, \"if you will bow down and worship me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said to him, \"Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali-- <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles-- <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> From that time on Jesus began to preach, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> At once they left their nets and followed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.
