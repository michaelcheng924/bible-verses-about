And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!  <strong>6</strong> When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.  <strong>7</strong> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.  <strong>8</strong> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;  <strong>9</strong> And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.  <strong>10</strong> Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?  <strong>11</strong> Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.  <strong>12</strong> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.  <strong>13</strong> When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.  <strong>14</strong> And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!  <strong>15</strong> But they cried out, Away with him, away with him,  crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.  <strong>16</strong> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.  <strong>17</strong> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place  of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:  <strong>18</strong> Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.  <strong>19</strong> And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.  <strong>20</strong> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and  Greek, and Latin.  <strong>21</strong> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.  <strong>22</strong> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.  <strong>23</strong> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.  <strong>24</strong> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.  <strong>25</strong> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.  <strong>26</strong> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!  <strong>27</strong> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.  <strong>28</strong> After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.  <strong>29</strong> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.  <strong>30</strong> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.  <strong>31</strong> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that  they might be taken away.  <strong>32</strong> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.  <strong>33</strong> But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:  <strong>34</strong> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.  <strong>35</strong> And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.  <strong>36</strong> For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.  <strong>37</strong> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.  <strong>38</strong> And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.  <strong>39</strong> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.  <strong>40</strong> Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.  <strong>41</strong> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.  <strong>42</strong> There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and went up to him again and again, saying, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" And they struck him in the face. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, \"Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, \"Here is the man!\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, \"Crucify! Crucify!\" But Pilate answered, \"You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The Jews insisted, \"We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> and he went back inside the palace. \"Where do you come from?\" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Do you refuse to speak to me?\" Pilate said. \"Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, \"If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. \"Here is your king,\" Pilate said to the Jews. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But they shouted, \"Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!Shall I crucify your king?\" Pilate asked. \"We have no king but Caesar,\" the chief priests answered. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read:|sc JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, \"Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Pilate answered, \"What I have written, I have written.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Let's not tear it,\" they said to one another. \"Let's decide by lot who will get it.\" This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, \"They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.\" So this is what the soldiers did. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \"Dear woman, here is your son,\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and to the disciple, \"Here is your mother.\" From that time on, this disciple took her into his home. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, \"I am thirsty.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When he had received the drink, Jesus said, \"It is finished.\" With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: \"Not one of his bones will be broken,\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and, as another scripture says, \"They will look on the one they have pierced.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
