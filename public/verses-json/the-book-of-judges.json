","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, \"I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.' Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now therefore I tell you that I will not drive them out before you; they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When the angel of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and they called that place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to the LORD. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In his anger against Israel the LORD handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hands of these raiders. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. Unlike their fathers, they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked, the way of obedience to the LORD 's commands. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and said, \"Because this nation has violated the covenant that I laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their forefathers did.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The LORD had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.

And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.  <strong>10</strong> And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.  <strong>11</strong> Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.  <strong>12</strong> And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.  <strong>13</strong> And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.  <strong>14</strong> And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.  <strong>15</strong> And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.  <strong>16</strong> But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.  <strong>17</strong> Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.  <strong>18</strong> And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.  <strong>19</strong> And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.  <strong>20</strong> Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.  <strong>21</strong> Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.  <strong>23</strong> So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.  <strong>24</strong> And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.  <strong>1</strong> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.  <strong>3</strong> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>4</strong> LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.  <strong>5</strong> The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.  <strong>7</strong> The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.  <strong>8</strong> They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  <strong>9</strong> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.  <strong>11</strong> They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants  of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.  <strong>12</strong> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.  <strong>13</strong> Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.  <strong>14</strong> Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.  <strong>15</strong> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.  <strong>16</strong> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.  <strong>17</strong> Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.  <strong>18</strong> Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.  <strong>19</strong> The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.  <strong>20</strong> They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.  <strong>21</strong> The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.  <strong>22</strong> Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.  <strong>23</strong> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.  <strong>24</strong> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.  <strong>25</strong> He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.  <strong>26</strong> She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.  <strong>27</strong> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.  <strong>28</strong> The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?  <strong>29</strong> Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,  <strong>30</strong> Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?  <strong>31</strong> So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.

And he said, I am.  <strong>12</strong> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?  <strong>13</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.  <strong>14</strong> She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:  all that I commanded her let her observe.  <strong>15</strong> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.  <strong>16</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?  <strong>18</strong> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?  <strong>19</strong> So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it  upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.  <strong>20</strong> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.  <strong>21</strong> But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.  <strong>23</strong> But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.  <strong>24</strong> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.  <strong>25</strong> And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.  <strong>1</strong> And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.  <strong>2</strong> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.  <strong>3</strong> Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.  <strong>4</strong> But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.  <strong>5</strong> Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.  <strong>6</strong> And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.  <strong>7</strong> And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.  <strong>8</strong> And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.  <strong>9</strong> And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.  <strong>10</strong> So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.  <strong>12</strong> And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:  <strong>13</strong> But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.  <strong>14</strong> And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?  <strong>16</strong> And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it  thee?  <strong>17</strong> And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.  <strong>18</strong> And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.  <strong>19</strong> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.  <strong>20</strong> But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.  <strong>1</strong> But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in.  <strong>2</strong> And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.  <strong>3</strong> And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.  <strong>4</strong> And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.  <strong>5</strong> And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.  <strong>6</strong> Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.  <strong>7</strong> And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.  <strong>8</strong> And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.  <strong>9</strong> Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.  <strong>10</strong> And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us.  <strong>11</strong> Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.  <strong>12</strong> And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.  <strong>13</strong> And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.  <strong>14</strong>           And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.  <strong>15</strong> And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.  <strong>16</strong> And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramath-lehi.  <strong>18</strong> And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?  <strong>19</strong> But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore, which is  in Lehi unto this day.  <strong>20</strong> And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.  <strong>1</strong> Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her.  <strong>2</strong> And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.  <strong>3</strong> And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.  <strong>4</strong> And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.  <strong>5</strong> And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces  of silver.  <strong>6</strong> And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee.  <strong>7</strong> And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  <strong>8</strong> Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.  <strong>9</strong> Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.  <strong>10</strong> And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.  <strong>11</strong> And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.  <strong>12</strong> Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.  <strong>13</strong> And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.  <strong>14</strong> And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.  <strong>15</strong> And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;  <strong>17</strong> That he told her all his heart, and said unto her. There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.  <strong>18</strong> And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.  <strong>19</strong> And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.  <strong>20</strong> And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.  <strong>21</strong> But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house.  <strong>22</strong> Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.  <strong>23</strong> Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.  <strong>24</strong> And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.  <strong>25</strong> And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.  <strong>26</strong> And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them.  <strong>27</strong> Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.  <strong>28</strong> And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.  <strong>29</strong> And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left.  <strong>30</strong> And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.  <strong>31</strong> Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, so the LORD delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was sterile and remained childless. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD appeared to her and said, \"You are sterile and childless, but you are going to conceive and have a son. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> because you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor may be used on his head, because the boy is to be a Nazirite, set apart to God from birth, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the woman went to her husband and told him, \"A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn't ask him where he came from, and he didn't tell me his name. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But he said to me, 'You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Manoah prayed to the LORD: \"O LORD, I beg you, let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The woman hurried to tell her husband, \"He's here! The man who appeared to me the other day!\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, \"Are you the one who talked to my wife?I am,\" he said. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Manoah asked him, \"When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule for the boy's life and work?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD answered, \"Your wife must do all that I have told her. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, \"We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD replied, \"Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food.

Amen.  <strong>26</strong> For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  <strong>27</strong> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.  <strong>28</strong> And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;  <strong>29</strong> Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,  <strong>30</strong> Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,  <strong>31</strong> Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:  <strong>32</strong> Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God-- <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong-- <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: \"The righteous will live by faith.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
