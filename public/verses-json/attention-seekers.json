power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.  <strong>2</strong> And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.  <strong>3</strong> For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.  <strong>4</strong> And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.  <strong>5</strong> For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.  <strong>6</strong> Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  <strong>7</strong> How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.  <strong>8</strong> Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is  the Lord God who judgeth her.  <strong>9</strong> And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,  <strong>10</strong> Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.  <strong>11</strong> And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:  <strong>12</strong> The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,  <strong>13</strong> And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.  <strong>14</strong> And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.  <strong>15</strong> The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,  <strong>16</strong> And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!  <strong>17</strong> For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  <strong>18</strong> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!  <strong>19</strong> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.  <strong>20</strong> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.  <strong>21</strong> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <strong>22</strong> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <strong>23</strong> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  <strong>24</strong> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> With a mighty voice he shouted: \"Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit, a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Then I heard another voice from heaven say: \"Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Mix her a double portion from her own cup. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, 'I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her: death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more-- <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble; <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"They will say, 'The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: \"With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's great men. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> In her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints, and of all who have been killed on the earth.\" "},{"_id":"6158feb55788f063699d84fe","topicId":"6158feaf5788f063699d84ea","verse":"Psalm 23:1-6","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<h4 id=\"p19023001_06-22\" class=\"psalm-title\">A Psalm of David.</h4>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023001_06-22\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v19023001-1\">23:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-22\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes me lie down in green pastures.</span><br><span id=\"p19023002_06-22\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me beside still waters.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-22\" class=\"indent line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He restores my soul.</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-22\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;He leads me in paths of righteousness</span><br><span id=\"p19023003_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his name’s sake.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023004_06-22\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will fear no evil,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-22\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are with me;</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your rod and your staff,</span><br><span id=\"p19023004_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they comfort me.</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n<span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p19023005_06-22\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You prepare a table before me</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of my enemies;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-22\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;you anoint my head with oil;</span><br><span id=\"p19023005_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cup overflows.</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-22\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v19023006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the days of my life,</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-22\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD</span><br><span id=\"p19023006_06-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forever.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  <strong>2</strong> He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  <strong>3</strong> He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  <strong>4</strong> Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  <strong>5</strong> Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  <strong>6</strong> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
