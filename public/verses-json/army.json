Jesus saith unto them, I amhe. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.  <strong>6</strong> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.  <strong>7</strong> Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>8</strong> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:  <strong>9</strong> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.  <strong>10</strong> Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.  <strong>11</strong> Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?  <strong>12</strong> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,  <strong>13</strong> And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.  <strong>14</strong> Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.  <strong>15</strong> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.  <strong>16</strong> But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.  <strong>17</strong> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.  <strong>18</strong> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.  <strong>19</strong> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.  <strong>20</strong> Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.  <strong>21</strong> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.  <strong>22</strong> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?  <strong>23</strong> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?  <strong>24</strong> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.  <strong>25</strong> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it,  and said, I am not.  <strong>26</strong> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?  <strong>27</strong> Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.  <strong>28</strong> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.  <strong>29</strong> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?  <strong>30</strong> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:  <strong>32</strong> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>33</strong> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?  <strong>35</strong> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  <strong>36</strong> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.  <strong>37</strong> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.  <strong>38</strong> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.  <strong>39</strong> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  <strong>40</strong> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I am he,\" Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Again he asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" And they said, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I told you that I am he,\" Jesus answered. \"If you are looking for me, then let these men go.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: \"I have not lost one of those you gave me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus commanded Peter, \"Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have spoken openly to the world,\" Jesus replied. \"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\" he demanded. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"If I said something wrong,\" Jesus replied, \"testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Pilate came out to them and asked, \"What charges are you bringing against this man?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"If he were not a criminal,\" they replied, \"we would not have handed him over to you.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Pilate said, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"But we have no right to execute anyone,\" the Jews objected. This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Is that your own idea,\" Jesus asked, \"or did others talk to you about me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Am I a Jew?\" Pilate replied. \"It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"You are a king, then!\" said Pilate. Jesus answered, \"You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"What is truth?\" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, \"I find no basis for a charge against him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They shouted back, \"No, not him! Give us Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.

But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment.

It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.' <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne; <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others?
