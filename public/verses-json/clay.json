Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and  to turn away thy wrath from them.  <strong>21</strong> Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.  <strong>22</strong> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.  <strong>23</strong> Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:  forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Go down to the potter's house, and there I will give you my message.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So I went down to the potter's house, and I saw him working at the wheel. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?\" declares the LORD. \"Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'This is what the LORD says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But they will reply, 'It's no use. We will continue with our own plans; each of us will follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.'\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD says: \"Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever cease to flow? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways and in the ancient paths. They made them walk in bypaths and on roads not built up. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Their land will be laid waste, an object of lasting scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Like a wind from the east, I will scatter them before their enemies; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They said, \"Come, let's make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not be lost, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let's attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Listen to me, O LORD; hear what my accusers are saying! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Should good be repaid with evil? Yet they have dug a pit for me. Remember that I stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So give their children over to famine; hand them over to the power of the sword. Let their wives be made childless and widows; let their men be put to death, their young men slain by the sword in battle. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them, for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But you know, O LORD, all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight. Let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.

Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.  <strong>7</strong> At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;  <strong>8</strong> If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.  <strong>9</strong> And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;  <strong>10</strong> If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.  <strong>11</strong> Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.  <strong>12</strong> And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.  <strong>14</strong> Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh  from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?  <strong>15</strong> Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;  <strong>16</strong> To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.  <strong>17</strong> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.  <strong>18</strong> Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.  <strong>19</strong> Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.  <strong>20</strong> Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and  to turn away thy wrath from them.  <strong>21</strong> Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.  <strong>22</strong> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.  <strong>23</strong> Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me:  forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.  <strong>1</strong> Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter’s earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests;  <strong>2</strong> And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is  by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,  <strong>3</strong> And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.  <strong>4</strong> Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;  <strong>5</strong> They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it into my mind:  <strong>6</strong> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.  <strong>7</strong> And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.  <strong>8</strong> And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.  <strong>9</strong> And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.  <strong>10</strong> Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,  <strong>11</strong> And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.  <strong>12</strong> Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and even make this city as Tophet:  <strong>13</strong> And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.  <strong>14</strong> Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD’S house; and said to all the people,  <strong>15</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Go down to the potter's house, and there I will give you my message.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So I went down to the potter's house, and I saw him working at the wheel. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then the word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?\" declares the LORD. \"Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, 'This is what the LORD says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But they will reply, 'It's no use. We will continue with our own plans; each of us will follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.'\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD says: \"Inquire among the nations: Who has ever heard anything like this? A most horrible thing has been done by Virgin Israel. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes? Do its cool waters from distant sources ever cease to flow? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to worthless idols, which made them stumble in their ways and in the ancient paths. They made them walk in bypaths and on roads not built up. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Their land will be laid waste, an object of lasting scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Like a wind from the east, I will scatter them before their enemies; I will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They said, \"Come, let's make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not be lost, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let's attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Listen to me, O LORD; hear what my accusers are saying!
