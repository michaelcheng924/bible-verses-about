The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Teach them the decrees and laws, and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But select capable men from all the people-men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain-and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.
