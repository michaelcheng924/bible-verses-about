And he was speechless.  <strong>13</strong> Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>14</strong> For many are called, but few are chosen. <strong>15</strong> Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.  <strong>16</strong> And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.  <strong>17</strong> Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?  <strong>18</strong> But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  <strong>19</strong> Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.  <strong>20</strong> And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?  <strong>21</strong> They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.  <strong>22</strong> When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.  <strong>23</strong> The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,  <strong>24</strong> Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.  <strong>25</strong> Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:  <strong>26</strong> Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.  <strong>27</strong> And last of all the woman died also.  <strong>28</strong> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.  <strong>29</strong> Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.  <strong>30</strong> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.  <strong>31</strong> But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,  <strong>32</strong> I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.  <strong>33</strong> And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.  <strong>34</strong> But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.  <strong>35</strong> Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,  <strong>36</strong> Master, which is the great commandment in the law?  <strong>37</strong> Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.  <strong>38</strong> This is the first and great commandment.  <strong>39</strong> And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  <strong>40</strong> On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.  <strong>41</strong> While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,  <strong>42</strong> Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David.  <strong>43</strong> He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,  <strong>44</strong> The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?  <strong>45</strong> If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?  <strong>46</strong> And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man  from that day forth ask him any more questions.

to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!  <strong>3</strong> Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.  <strong>4</strong> For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes.  <strong>5</strong> They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.  <strong>6</strong> The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that  shall not profit them.  <strong>7</strong> For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit still.  <strong>8</strong> Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:  <strong>9</strong> That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD:  <strong>10</strong> Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:  <strong>11</strong> Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon:  <strong>13</strong> Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant.  <strong>14</strong> And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.  <strong>15</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.  <strong>16</strong> But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.  <strong>17</strong> One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.  <strong>18</strong> And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him.  <strong>19</strong> For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.  <strong>20</strong> And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:  <strong>21</strong> And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is  the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.  <strong>22</strong> Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence.  <strong>23</strong> Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.  <strong>24</strong> The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.  <strong>25</strong> And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.  <strong>26</strong> Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with  his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:  <strong>28</strong> And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.  <strong>29</strong> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.  <strong>30</strong> And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.  <strong>31</strong> For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.  <strong>32</strong> And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.  <strong>33</strong> For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> \"Woe to the obstinate children,\" declares the LORD, \"to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin; <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> who go down to Egypt without consulting me; who look for help to Pharaoh's protection, to Egypt's shade for refuge. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Pharaoh's protection will be to your shame, Egypt's shade will bring you disgrace. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them, who bring neither help nor advantage, but only shame and disgrace.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> An oracle concerning the animals of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lions and lionesses, of adders and darting snakes, the envoys carry their riches on donkeys' backs, their treasures on the humps of camels, to that unprofitable nation, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Go now, write it on a tablet for them, inscribe it on a scroll, that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> These are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the LORD's instruction. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They say to the seers, \"See no more visions!\" and to the prophets, \"Give us no more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Leave this way, get off this path, and stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says: \"Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says: \"In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You said, 'No, we will flee on horses.' Therefore you will flee! You said, 'We will ride off on swift horses.' Therefore your pursuers will be swift! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; he rises to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, \"This is the way; walk in it.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then you will defile your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, \"Away with you!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is a consuming fire. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> His breath is like a rushing torrent, rising up to the neck. He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people go up with flutes to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The LORD will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria; with his scepter he will strike them down. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Every stroke the LORD lays on them with his punishing rod will be to the music of tambourines and harps, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.
