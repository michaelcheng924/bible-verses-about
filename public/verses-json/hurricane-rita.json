can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?  <strong>5</strong> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>6</strong> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  <strong>7</strong> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  <strong>8</strong> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  <strong>9</strong> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?

 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice.

And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.  <strong>6</strong> And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.  <strong>7</strong> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.  <strong>8</strong> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.  <strong>9</strong> Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.  <strong>10</strong> As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.  <strong>11</strong> Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.  <strong>12</strong> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.  <strong>13</strong> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.  <strong>14</strong> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.  <strong>15</strong> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.  <strong>16</strong> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.  <strong>17</strong> When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.  <strong>18</strong> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.  <strong>19</strong> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.  <strong>20</strong> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their  spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.  <strong>21</strong> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these  stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was  in the wheels.  <strong>22</strong> And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.  <strong>23</strong> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.  <strong>24</strong> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.  <strong>25</strong> And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.  <strong>26</strong> And above the firmament that was over their heads was  the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.  <strong>27</strong> And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.  <strong>28</strong> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was  the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.  <strong>1</strong> And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.  <strong>2</strong> And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.  <strong>3</strong> And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.  <strong>4</strong> For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>5</strong> And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.  <strong>6</strong> And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.  <strong>7</strong> And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.  <strong>8</strong> But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.  <strong>9</strong> And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;  <strong>10</strong> And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.  <strong>1</strong> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.  <strong>2</strong> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.  <strong>3</strong> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.  <strong>4</strong> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.  <strong>5</strong> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;  <strong>6</strong> Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.  <strong>7</strong> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.  <strong>8</strong> Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.  <strong>9</strong> As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.  <strong>10</strong> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.  <strong>11</strong> And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.  <strong>12</strong> Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.  <strong>13</strong> I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.  <strong>14</strong> So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.  <strong>15</strong> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>17</strong> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.  <strong>18</strong> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  <strong>19</strong> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.  <strong>20</strong> Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.  <strong>21</strong> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.  <strong>22</strong> And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.  <strong>24</strong> Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.  <strong>25</strong> But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:  <strong>26</strong> And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are  a rebellious house.  <strong>27</strong> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.

strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.  <strong>3</strong> I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  <strong>4</strong> The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.  <strong>5</strong> The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.  <strong>6</strong> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.  <strong>7</strong> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.  <strong>8</strong> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  <strong>9</strong> He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was  under his feet.  <strong>10</strong> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.  <strong>11</strong> He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.  <strong>12</strong> At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.  <strong>14</strong> Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.  <strong>15</strong> Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.  <strong>16</strong> He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.  <strong>17</strong> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.  <strong>18</strong> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  <strong>19</strong> He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  <strong>20</strong> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  <strong>21</strong> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  <strong>22</strong> For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.  <strong>23</strong> I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.  <strong>25</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;  <strong>26</strong> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.  <strong>27</strong> For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.  <strong>28</strong> For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.  <strong>29</strong> For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.  <strong>30</strong>             As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.  <strong>31</strong> For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?  <strong>32</strong>             It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.  <strong>33</strong> He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.  <strong>34</strong> He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  <strong>35</strong> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.  <strong>36</strong> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.  <strong>37</strong> I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.  <strong>38</strong> I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.  <strong>39</strong> For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.  <strong>40</strong> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.  <strong>41</strong> They cried, but there was none to save them: even  unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  <strong>42</strong> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.  <strong>43</strong> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and  thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom  I have not known shall serve me.  <strong>44</strong> As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.  <strong>45</strong> The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.  <strong>46</strong> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.  <strong>47</strong>             It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.  <strong>48</strong> He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  <strong>49</strong> Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.  <strong>50</strong> Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> I love you, O LORD, my strength. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The cords of death entangled me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried to my God for help. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came before him, into his ears. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because he was angry. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him- the dark rain clouds of the sky. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He shot his arrows and scattered the enemies, great bolts of lightning and routed them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of breath from your nostrils. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> You save the humble but bring low those whose eyes are haughty. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You, O LORD, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> You give me your shield of victory, and your right hand sustains me; you stoop down to make me great. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I crushed them so that they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> They cried for help, but there was no one to save them- to the LORD, but he did not answer. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I beat them as fine as dust borne on the wind; I poured them out like mud in the streets. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> You have delivered me from the attacks of the people; you have made me the head of nations; people I did not know are subject to me. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> As soon as they hear me, they obey me; foreigners cringe before me. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God my Savior! <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> He is the God who avenges me, who subdues nations under me, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> who saves me from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Therefore I will praise you among the nations, O LORD; I will sing praises to your name. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever.

Now the famine was severe in Samaria. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water.) <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018006_04-13\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>And he answered him, “It is I. Go, tell your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>And he said, “How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>As the LORD your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, ‘He is not here,’ he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’ <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the LORD from my youth. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the LORD, how I hid a hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>And now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold, Elijah is here”’; and he will kill me.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said, “As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018016_04-13\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is it you, you troubler of Israel?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>And he answered, “I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father’s house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the LORD and followed the Baals. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”</p>\n\n<p id=\"p11018019_09-13\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the people, “I, even I only, am left a prophet of the LORD, but Baal’s prophets are 450 men. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>And you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the LORD, and the God who answers by fire, he is God.” And all the people answered, “It is well spoken.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “O Baal, answer us!” But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018029_09-13\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near to me.” And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been thrown down. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD came, saying, “Israel shall be your name,” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And he said, “Do it a second time.” And they did it a second time. And he said, “Do it a third time.” And they did it a third time. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water.</p>\n<p id=\"p11018035_09-13\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>Answer me, O LORD, answer me, that this people may know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>Then the fire of the LORD fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, “The LORD, he is God; the LORD, he is God.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v11018040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>And Elijah said to them, “Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape.” And they seized them.

And there was a sore famine in Samaria.  <strong>3</strong> And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his  house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:  <strong>4</strong> For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)  <strong>5</strong> And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.  <strong>6</strong> So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.  <strong>7</strong> And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?  <strong>8</strong> And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>9</strong> And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  <strong>10</strong> As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is  not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.  <strong>11</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.  <strong>12</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.  <strong>13</strong> Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  <strong>14</strong> And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here:  and he shall slay me.  <strong>15</strong> And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.  <strong>16</strong> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  <strong>18</strong> And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.  <strong>19</strong> Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.  <strong>20</strong> So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.  <strong>21</strong> And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.  <strong>23</strong> Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it  on wood, and put no fire under:  <strong>24</strong> And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.  <strong>25</strong> And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.  <strong>26</strong> And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.  <strong>28</strong> And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.  <strong>30</strong> And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.  <strong>31</strong> And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:  <strong>32</strong> And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.  <strong>33</strong> And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it  the second time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.  <strong>35</strong> And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water.  <strong>36</strong> And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that  I have done all these things at thy word.  <strong>37</strong> Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.  <strong>38</strong> Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.  <strong>39</strong> And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.  <strong>40</strong> And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.  <strong>41</strong> And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.  <strong>42</strong> So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,  <strong>43</strong> And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.  <strong>44</strong> And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.  <strong>45</strong> And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.  <strong>46</strong> And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah: \"Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land.\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While Jezebel was killing off the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Ahab had said to Obadiah, \"Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, \"Is it really you, my lord Elijah?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Yes,\" he replied. \"Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"What have I done wrong,\" asked Obadiah, \"that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Elijah said, \"As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When he saw Elijah, he said to him, \"Is that you, you troubler of Israel?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have not made trouble for Israel,\" Elijah replied. \"But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD's commands and have followed the Baals. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Elijah went before the people and said, \"How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him.\" But the people said nothing. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to them, \"I am the only one of the LORD's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire-he is God.\" Then all the people said, \"What you say is good.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, \"Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. \"O Baal, answer us!\" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At noon Elijah began to taunt them. \"Shout louder!\" he said. \"Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Elijah said to all the people, \"Come here to me.\" They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, \"Your name shall be Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, \"Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Do it again,\" he said, and they did it again. \"Do it a third time,\" he ordered, and they did it the third time. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed: \"O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, \"The LORD -he is God! The LORD -he is God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Elijah commanded them, \"Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!\" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And Elijah said to Ahab, \"Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Go and look toward the sea,\" he told his servant. And he went up and looked. \"There is nothing there,\" he said. Seven times Elijah said, \"Go back.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The seventh time the servant reported, \"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea.\" So Elijah said, \"Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
