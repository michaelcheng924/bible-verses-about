Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.  <strong>14</strong> And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.  <strong>15</strong> Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.  <strong>16</strong> What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.  <strong>17</strong> But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.  <strong>18</strong> Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.  <strong>19</strong> What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?  <strong>20</strong> For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Everything is permissible for me\"--but not everything is beneficial. \"Everything is permissible for me\"--but I will not be mastered by anything. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Food for the stomach and the stomach for food\"--but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, \"The two will become one flesh.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.
