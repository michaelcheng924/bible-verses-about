He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  <strong>29</strong> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:  <strong>30</strong> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  <strong>31</strong> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  <strong>32</strong> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.  <strong>33</strong> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.  <strong>1</strong> Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.  <strong>2</strong> Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)  <strong>3</strong> That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.  <strong>4</strong> And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.  <strong>5</strong> Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;  <strong>6</strong> Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;  <strong>7</strong> With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:  <strong>8</strong> Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.  <strong>9</strong> And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.  <strong>10</strong> Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.  <strong>11</strong> Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.  <strong>12</strong> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  <strong>13</strong> Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  <strong>14</strong> Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;  <strong>15</strong> And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;  <strong>16</strong> Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  <strong>17</strong> And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:  <strong>18</strong> Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;  <strong>19</strong> And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,  <strong>20</strong> For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.  <strong>21</strong> But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:  <strong>22</strong> Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.  <strong>23</strong> Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong>24</strong> Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.

Thus were  their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.  <strong>5</strong> And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,  <strong>6</strong> Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.  <strong>7</strong> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were  the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.  <strong>8</strong> Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.  <strong>9</strong> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.  <strong>10</strong> These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.  <strong>11</strong> And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.  <strong>12</strong> She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.  <strong>13</strong> Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took  both one way,  <strong>14</strong> And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,  <strong>15</strong> Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:  <strong>16</strong> And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.  <strong>17</strong> And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.  <strong>18</strong> So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.  <strong>19</strong> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.  <strong>20</strong> For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  <strong>21</strong> Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;  <strong>23</strong> The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.  <strong>24</strong> And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.  <strong>25</strong> And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.  <strong>26</strong> They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.  <strong>27</strong> Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.  <strong>28</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:  <strong>29</strong> And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>30</strong> I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.  <strong>31</strong> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.  <strong>32</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.  <strong>33</strong> Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.  <strong>34</strong> Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>35</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>36</strong> The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;  <strong>37</strong> That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.  <strong>38</strong> Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.  <strong>39</strong> For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.  <strong>40</strong> And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,  <strong>41</strong> And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.  <strong>42</strong> And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.  <strong>43</strong> Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  <strong>44</strong> Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.  <strong>45</strong> And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.  <strong>46</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.  <strong>47</strong> And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords;

She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans portrayed in red, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"For this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am about to hand you over to those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you naked and bare, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> have brought this upon you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"You will drink your sister's cup, a cup large and deep; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds so much. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You will drink it and drain it dry; you will dash it to pieces and tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Since you have forgotten me and thrust me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The LORD said to me: \"Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, painted your eyes and put on your jewelry. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and oil that belonged to me. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; Sabeans were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the arms of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, 'Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.' <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"This is what the Sovereign LORD says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"So I will put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> You will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD.\" ","modified":"2022-12-31T03:13:36.219Z"},{"_id":"616d838475868033c7104eb1","topicId":"616d838375868033c7104eae","verse":"Matthew 7:17-27","votes":11,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40007017_01-3\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007017-1\">17&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007018-1\">18&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007019-1\">19&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007020-1\">20&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.</span></p>\n\n<p id=\"p40007020_05-3\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007021-1\">21&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007022-1\">22&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007023-1\">23&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’</span></p>\n\n<p id=\"p40007023_11-3\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007024-1\">24&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007025-1\">25&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007026-1\">26&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40007027-1\">27&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>17</strong> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  <strong>18</strong> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  <strong>19</strong> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. <strong>21</strong>           Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>22</strong> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  <strong>23</strong> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <strong>24</strong>           Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:  <strong>25</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  <strong>26</strong> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:  <strong>27</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.

when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.  <strong>23</strong> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:  <strong>24</strong> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.  <strong>25</strong> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.  <strong>26</strong> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.  <strong>27</strong> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?  <strong>28</strong> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  <strong>29</strong> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.  <strong>30</strong> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;  <strong>31</strong> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.  <strong>32</strong> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.  <strong>33</strong> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.  <strong>34</strong> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.  <strong>35</strong> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.  <strong>1</strong> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.  <strong>2</strong> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.  <strong>3</strong> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.  <strong>4</strong> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:  <strong>5</strong> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.  <strong>6</strong> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,  <strong>7</strong> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,  <strong>8</strong> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,  <strong>9</strong> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:  <strong>10</strong> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.  <strong>11</strong> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:  <strong>12</strong> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)  <strong>13</strong> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,  <strong>14</strong> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.  <strong>15</strong> Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  <strong>16</strong> I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works,  with fine linen of Egypt.  <strong>17</strong> I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  <strong>18</strong> Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.  <strong>19</strong> For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:  <strong>20</strong> He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.  <strong>21</strong> With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.  <strong>22</strong> He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;  <strong>23</strong> Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.  <strong>24</strong> Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.  <strong>25</strong> Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.  <strong>26</strong> For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men  have been slain by her.  <strong>27</strong> Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.  <strong>1</strong> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  <strong>2</strong> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  <strong>3</strong> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  <strong>4</strong> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.  <strong>5</strong> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  <strong>6</strong> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.  <strong>7</strong> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  <strong>8</strong> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is  nothing froward or perverse in them.  <strong>9</strong> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.  <strong>10</strong> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  <strong>11</strong> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.  <strong>12</strong> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  <strong>13</strong> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  <strong>14</strong> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.  <strong>15</strong> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  <strong>16</strong> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.  <strong>17</strong> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.  <strong>18</strong> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  <strong>19</strong> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.  <strong>20</strong> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:  <strong>21</strong> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  <strong>22</strong> The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.  <strong>23</strong> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.  <strong>24</strong> When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.  <strong>25</strong> Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:  <strong>26</strong> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.  <strong>27</strong> When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:  <strong>28</strong> When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:  <strong>29</strong> When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:  <strong>30</strong> Then I was by him, as one brought up with him:  and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;  <strong>31</strong> Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.  <strong>32</strong> Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.  <strong>33</strong> Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.  <strong>34</strong> Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.  <strong>35</strong> For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.  <strong>36</strong> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.  <strong>1</strong> Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:  <strong>2</strong> She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.  <strong>3</strong> She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,  <strong>4</strong> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  <strong>5</strong> Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.  <strong>6</strong> Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.  <strong>7</strong> He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.  <strong>8</strong> Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.  <strong>9</strong> Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.  <strong>10</strong> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.  <strong>11</strong> For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.  <strong>12</strong> If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it. <strong>13</strong> A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.  <strong>14</strong> For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,  <strong>15</strong> To call passengers who go right on their ways:  <strong>16</strong> Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for  him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,  <strong>17</strong> Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.  <strong>18</strong> But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that  her guests are in the depths of hell.

Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,  <strong>21</strong> That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?  <strong>22</strong> And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.  <strong>23</strong> And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;)  <strong>24</strong> That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street.  <strong>25</strong> Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.  <strong>26</strong> Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.  <strong>27</strong> Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.  <strong>29</strong> Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.  <strong>30</strong> How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;  <strong>31</strong> In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;  <strong>32</strong> But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!  <strong>33</strong> They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.  <strong>34</strong> And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.  <strong>35</strong> Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:  <strong>36</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them;  <strong>37</strong> Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.  <strong>38</strong> And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.  <strong>39</strong> And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.  <strong>40</strong> They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.  <strong>41</strong> And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.  <strong>42</strong> So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.  <strong>43</strong> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.  <strong>44</strong> Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.  <strong>45</strong> Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.  <strong>46</strong> And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.  <strong>47</strong> Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing,  thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.  <strong>48</strong> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.  <strong>49</strong> Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  <strong>50</strong> And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.  <strong>51</strong> Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.  <strong>52</strong> Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.  <strong>53</strong> When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:  <strong>54</strong> That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.  <strong>55</strong> When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate.  <strong>56</strong> For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride,  <strong>57</strong> Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy  reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.  <strong>58</strong> Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the LORD.  <strong>59</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.  <strong>60</strong> Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.  <strong>61</strong> Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.  <strong>62</strong> And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD:  <strong>63</strong> That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>1</strong> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;  <strong>3</strong> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:  <strong>4</strong> He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.  <strong>5</strong> He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters, and set it as  a willow tree.  <strong>6</strong> And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.  <strong>7</strong> There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend her roots toward him, and shot forth her branches toward him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.  <strong>8</strong> It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.  <strong>9</strong> Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.  <strong>10</strong> Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither, when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the furrows where it grew.  <strong>11</strong> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>12</strong> Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem, and hath taken the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and led them with him to Babylon;  <strong>13</strong> And hath taken of the king’s seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:  <strong>14</strong> That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.  <strong>15</strong> But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? or shall he break the covenant, and be delivered?  <strong>16</strong> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where  the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.  <strong>17</strong> Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:  <strong>18</strong> Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these things, he shall not escape.  <strong>19</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head.  <strong>20</strong> And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.  <strong>21</strong> And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it. <strong>22</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:  <strong>23</strong> In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.  <strong>24</strong> And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.  <strong>1</strong> The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,  <strong>2</strong> What mean ye, that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?  <strong>3</strong> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion  any more to use this proverb in Israel.  <strong>4</strong> Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.  <strong>5</strong> But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,  <strong>6</strong> And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,  <strong>7</strong> And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;  <strong>8</strong> He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,  <strong>9</strong> Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>10</strong> If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things,  <strong>11</strong> And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife,  <strong>12</strong> Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,  <strong>13</strong> Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.  <strong>14</strong> Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,  <strong>15</strong> That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife,  <strong>16</strong> Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,  <strong>17</strong> That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that  hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.  <strong>18</strong> As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.  <strong>19</strong> Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.  <strong>20</strong> The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.  <strong>21</strong> But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.  <strong>22</strong> All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.  <strong>23</strong> Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?  <strong>24</strong> But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.  <strong>25</strong> Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?  <strong>26</strong> When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.  <strong>27</strong> Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.  <strong>28</strong> Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.  <strong>29</strong> Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?  <strong>30</strong> Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.  <strong>31</strong> Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O house of Israel?  <strong>32</strong> For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.  <strong>1</strong> Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,  <strong>2</strong> And say, What is thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young lions.  <strong>3</strong> And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.  <strong>4</strong> The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.  <strong>5</strong> Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.  <strong>6</strong> And he went up and down among the lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, and devoured men.  <strong>7</strong> And he knew their desolate palaces, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.  <strong>8</strong> Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.  <strong>9</strong> And they put him in ward in chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.  <strong>10</strong> Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.  <strong>11</strong> And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.  <strong>12</strong> But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.  <strong>13</strong> And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.  <strong>14</strong> And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month,  the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the LORD, and sat before me.  <strong>2</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,  <strong>3</strong> Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.  <strong>4</strong> Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:  <strong>5</strong> And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;  <strong>6</strong> In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:  <strong>7</strong> Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.  <strong>8</strong> But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.  <strong>9</strong> But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.  <strong>10</strong> Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.  <strong>11</strong> And I gave them my statutes, and shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.  <strong>12</strong> Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.  <strong>13</strong> But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if  a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.  <strong>14</strong> But I wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.  <strong>15</strong> Yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;  <strong>16</strong> Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.  <strong>17</strong> Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.  <strong>18</strong> But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:  <strong>19</strong> I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;  <strong>20</strong> And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the LORD your God.  <strong>21</strong> Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.  <strong>22</strong> Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.  <strong>23</strong> I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;  <strong>24</strong> Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.  <strong>25</strong> Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;  <strong>26</strong> And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.  <strong>28</strong> For when I had brought them into the land, for  the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.  <strong>29</strong> Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?  <strong>31</strong> For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.  <strong>32</strong> And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.  <strong>33</strong>           As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:  <strong>34</strong> And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.  <strong>35</strong> And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.  <strong>36</strong> Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>37</strong> And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:  <strong>38</strong> And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.  <strong>39</strong> As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.  <strong>40</strong> For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.  <strong>41</strong> I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.  <strong>42</strong> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.  <strong>43</strong> And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.  <strong>44</strong> And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>45</strong> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>46</strong> Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop thy word  toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;  <strong>47</strong> And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.  <strong>48</strong> And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.  <strong>49</strong> Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables?  <strong>1</strong> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word  toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,  <strong>3</strong> And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am  against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.  <strong>4</strong> Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:  <strong>5</strong> That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.  <strong>6</strong> Sigh therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy  loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.  <strong>7</strong> And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>8</strong> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>9</strong> Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:  <strong>10</strong> It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it contemneth the rod of my son, as every tree.  <strong>11</strong> And he hath given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.  <strong>12</strong> Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be upon my people, it shall be upon all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people: smite therefore upon thy thigh.  <strong>13</strong> Because it is a trial, and what if the sword contemn even the rod? it shall be no more, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>14</strong> Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which entereth into their privy chambers.  <strong>15</strong> I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.  <strong>16</strong> Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, whithersoever thy face is set.  <strong>17</strong> I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.  <strong>18</strong> The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,  <strong>19</strong> Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.  <strong>20</strong> Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced.  <strong>21</strong> For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.  <strong>22</strong> At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.  <strong>23</strong> And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.  <strong>25</strong> And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,  <strong>26</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.  <strong>27</strong> I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more,  until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.  <strong>28</strong> And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:  <strong>29</strong> Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.  <strong>30</strong> Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity.  <strong>31</strong> And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, and skilful to destroy.  <strong>32</strong> Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it. <strong>1</strong> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.  <strong>3</strong> Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.  <strong>4</strong> Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.  <strong>5</strong> Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.  <strong>6</strong> Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.  <strong>7</strong> In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.  <strong>8</strong> Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.  <strong>9</strong> In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.  <strong>10</strong> In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.  <strong>11</strong> And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.  <strong>12</strong> In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>13</strong> Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.  <strong>14</strong> Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.  <strong>15</strong> And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.  <strong>16</strong> And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.  <strong>17</strong> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>18</strong> Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.  <strong>19</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.  <strong>20</strong> As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it;  so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.  <strong>21</strong> Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.  <strong>22</strong> As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.  <strong>23</strong> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>24</strong> Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.  <strong>25</strong> There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.  <strong>26</strong> Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.  <strong>27</strong> Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.  <strong>28</strong> And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter,  seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.  <strong>29</strong> The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.  <strong>30</strong> And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.  <strong>31</strong> Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>1</strong> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:  <strong>3</strong> And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.  <strong>4</strong> And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were  their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.  <strong>5</strong> And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,  <strong>6</strong> Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.  <strong>7</strong> Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were  the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.  <strong>8</strong> Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their whoredom upon her.  <strong>9</strong> Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.  <strong>10</strong> These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.  <strong>11</strong> And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.  <strong>12</strong> She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.  <strong>13</strong> Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took  both one way,  <strong>14</strong> And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,  <strong>15</strong> Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:  <strong>16</strong> And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.  <strong>17</strong> And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.  <strong>18</strong> So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.  <strong>19</strong> Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.  <strong>20</strong> For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.  <strong>21</strong> Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.  <strong>22</strong> Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;  <strong>23</strong> The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.  <strong>24</strong> And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.  <strong>25</strong> And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.  <strong>26</strong> They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.  <strong>27</strong> Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.  <strong>28</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:  <strong>29</strong> And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>30</strong> I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.  <strong>31</strong> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thine hand.  <strong>32</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.  <strong>33</strong> Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.  <strong>34</strong> Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>35</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.  <strong>36</strong> The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;  <strong>37</strong> That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.  <strong>38</strong> Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.  <strong>39</strong> For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house.  <strong>40</strong> And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,  <strong>41</strong> And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.  <strong>42</strong> And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.  <strong>43</strong> Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit whoredoms with her, and she with them?  <strong>44</strong> Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.  <strong>45</strong> And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.  <strong>46</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.  <strong>47</strong> And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.  <strong>48</strong> Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.  <strong>49</strong> And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.  <strong>1</strong> Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day  of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.  <strong>3</strong> And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:  <strong>4</strong> Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.  <strong>5</strong> Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.  <strong>6</strong> Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it.  <strong>7</strong> For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;  <strong>8</strong> That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.  <strong>9</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.  <strong>10</strong> Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.  <strong>11</strong> Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.  <strong>12</strong> She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.  <strong>13</strong> In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.  <strong>14</strong> I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>15</strong> Also the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>16</strong> Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.  <strong>17</strong> Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy  lips, and eat not the bread of men.  <strong>18</strong> So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.  <strong>19</strong> And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?  <strong>20</strong> Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>21</strong> Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.  <strong>22</strong> And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.  <strong>23</strong> And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.  <strong>24</strong> Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.  <strong>25</strong> Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,  <strong>26</strong> That he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears?  <strong>27</strong> In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;  <strong>3</strong> And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;  <strong>4</strong> Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.  <strong>5</strong> And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.  <strong>6</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine  hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;  <strong>7</strong> Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.  <strong>8</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;  <strong>9</strong> Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,  <strong>10</strong> Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.  <strong>11</strong> And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.  <strong>12</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;  <strong>13</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.  <strong>14</strong> And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>15</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it  for the old hatred;  <strong>16</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.  <strong>17</strong> And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day  of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:  <strong>3</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.  <strong>4</strong> And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.  <strong>5</strong> It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.  <strong>6</strong> And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.  <strong>7</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.  <strong>8</strong> He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee.  <strong>9</strong> And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers.  <strong>10</strong> By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.  <strong>11</strong> With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.  <strong>12</strong> And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.  <strong>13</strong> And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard.  <strong>14</strong> And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place  to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>15</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee?  <strong>16</strong> Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.  <strong>17</strong> And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!  <strong>18</strong> Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.  <strong>19</strong> For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;  <strong>20</strong> When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;  <strong>21</strong> I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more:  though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>1</strong> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Now, thou son of man, take up a lamentation for Tyrus;  <strong>3</strong> And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, which art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty.  <strong>4</strong> Thy borders are in the midst of the seas, thy builders have perfected thy beauty.  <strong>5</strong> They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.  <strong>6</strong> Of the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought  out of the isles of Chittim.  <strong>7</strong> Fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee.  <strong>8</strong> The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, O Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots.  <strong>9</strong> The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers: all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise.  <strong>10</strong> They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army, thy men of war: they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thy comeliness.  <strong>11</strong> The men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect.  <strong>12</strong> Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.  <strong>13</strong> Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market.  <strong>14</strong> They of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.  <strong>15</strong> The men of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles were  the merchandise of thine hand: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony.  <strong>16</strong> Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple, and broidered work, and fine linen, and coral, and agate.  <strong>17</strong> Judah, and the land of Israel, they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market wheat of Minnith, and Pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm.  <strong>18</strong> Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.  <strong>19</strong> Dan also and Javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs: bright iron, cassia, and calamus, were in thy market.  <strong>20</strong> Dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots.  <strong>21</strong> Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.  <strong>22</strong> The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were thy merchants: they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.  <strong>23</strong> Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and  Chilmad, were thy merchants.  <strong>24</strong> These were thy merchants in all sorts of things,  in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.  <strong>25</strong> The ships of Tarshish did sing of thee in thy market: and thou wast replenished, and made very glorious in the midst of the seas.  <strong>26</strong> Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters: the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas.  <strong>27</strong> Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is  in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.  <strong>28</strong> The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.  <strong>29</strong> And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land;  <strong>30</strong> And shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes:  <strong>31</strong> And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee, and gird them with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and  bitter wailing.  <strong>32</strong> And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?  <strong>33</strong> When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise.  <strong>34</strong> In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.  <strong>35</strong> All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.  <strong>36</strong> The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be  a terror, and never shalt be any more.  <strong>1</strong> The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am  a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:  <strong>3</strong> Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:  <strong>4</strong> With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches, and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:  <strong>5</strong> By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:  <strong>6</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God;  <strong>7</strong> Behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.  <strong>8</strong> They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas.  <strong>9</strong> Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and no God, in the hand of him that slayeth thee.  <strong>10</strong> Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>11</strong> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>12</strong> Son of man, take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.  <strong>13</strong> Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.  <strong>14</strong> Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.  <strong>15</strong> Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.  <strong>16</strong> By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.  <strong>17</strong> Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.  <strong>18</strong> Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.  <strong>19</strong> All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.  <strong>20</strong> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,  <strong>21</strong> Son of man, set thy face against Zidon, and prophesy against it,  <strong>22</strong> And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.  <strong>23</strong> For I will send into her pestilence, and blood into her street; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the LORD.  <strong>24</strong> And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.  <strong>25</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"'Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, \"Live!\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels. Your breasts were formed and your hair grew, you who were naked and bare. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign LORD, and you became mine. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"'I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> and I put a ring on your nose, earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was fine flour, honey and olive oil. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"'But you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute. You lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> You took some of your garments to make gaudy high places, where you carried on your prostitution. Such things should not happen, nor should they ever occur. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Also the food I provided for you-the fine flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat-you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign LORD. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"'And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"'Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign LORD. In addition to all your other wickedness, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At the head of every street you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, offering your body with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, and provoked me to anger with your increasing promiscuity. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied.

On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"from now on give us this bread.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> I am the bread of life. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)
