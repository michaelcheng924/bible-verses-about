The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?  <strong>5</strong> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>6</strong> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  <strong>7</strong> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.  <strong>8</strong> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.  <strong>9</strong> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?  <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  <strong>11</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.  <strong>12</strong> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God.

You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"How can this be?\" Nicodemus asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You are Israel's teacher,\" said Jesus, \"and do you not understand these things? <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> (This was before John was put in prison.) <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They came to John and said to him, \"Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To this John replied, \"A man can receive only what is given him from heaven. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth.

 <strong>2</strong> It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.  <strong>3</strong> And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.  <strong>4</strong> And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  <strong>6</strong> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.  <strong>7</strong> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.

O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.  <strong>26</strong> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  <strong>27</strong> How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul-no longer rubbed with oil. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Saul and Jonathan- in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me.
