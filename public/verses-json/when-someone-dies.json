And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  <strong>8</strong> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.  <strong>9</strong> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.  <strong>10</strong> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.  <strong>11</strong> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.  <strong>12</strong> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.  <strong>13</strong> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.  <strong>14</strong> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.  <strong>15</strong> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time,  <strong>16</strong> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:  <strong>17</strong> That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;  <strong>18</strong> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.  <strong>19</strong> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.  <strong>20</strong> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor;  <strong>21</strong> Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,  <strong>22</strong> And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.  <strong>23</strong> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.  <strong>24</strong> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.  <strong>1</strong> And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were  the years of the life of Sarah.  <strong>2</strong> And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.  <strong>3</strong> And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying,  <strong>4</strong> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.  <strong>5</strong> And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,  <strong>6</strong> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.  <strong>7</strong> And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.  <strong>8</strong> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,  <strong>9</strong> That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.  <strong>10</strong> And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even  of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,  <strong>11</strong> Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.  <strong>12</strong> And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.  <strong>13</strong> And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.  <strong>14</strong> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,  <strong>15</strong> My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.  <strong>16</strong> And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.  <strong>17</strong> And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were  in all the borders round about, were made sure  <strong>18</strong> Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.  <strong>19</strong> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.  <strong>20</strong> And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.  <strong>1</strong> And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.  <strong>2</strong> And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:  <strong>3</strong> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:  <strong>4</strong> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac.  <strong>5</strong> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?  <strong>6</strong> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.  <strong>7</strong> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.  <strong>8</strong> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.  <strong>9</strong> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.  <strong>10</strong> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.  <strong>11</strong> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.  <strong>12</strong> And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.  <strong>13</strong> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:  <strong>14</strong> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that  thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.  <strong>16</strong> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.  <strong>17</strong> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.  <strong>18</strong> And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.  <strong>19</strong> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.  <strong>20</strong> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.  <strong>21</strong> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.  <strong>22</strong> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;  <strong>23</strong> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?  <strong>24</strong> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.  <strong>25</strong> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.  <strong>26</strong> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being  in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.  <strong>28</strong> And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these things.  <strong>29</strong> And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.  <strong>31</strong> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.  <strong>32</strong> And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that were with him.  <strong>33</strong> And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.  <strong>35</strong> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.  <strong>36</strong> And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.  <strong>37</strong> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:  <strong>38</strong> But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.  <strong>39</strong> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.  <strong>40</strong> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:  <strong>41</strong> Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.  <strong>42</strong> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;  <strong>43</strong> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;  <strong>44</strong> And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.  <strong>45</strong> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.  <strong>46</strong> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,  and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.  <strong>47</strong> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.  <strong>48</strong> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.  <strong>49</strong> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.  <strong>50</strong> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.  <strong>52</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.  <strong>53</strong> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.  <strong>54</strong> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.  <strong>55</strong> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.  <strong>56</strong> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.  <strong>57</strong> And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  <strong>58</strong> And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.  <strong>59</strong> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.  <strong>60</strong> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.  <strong>61</strong> And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.  <strong>62</strong> And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.  <strong>63</strong> And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.  <strong>64</strong> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.  <strong>65</strong> For she had said unto the servant, What man is  this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had  said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.  <strong>66</strong> And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.  <strong>67</strong> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death. <strong>1</strong> Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.  <strong>2</strong> And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.  <strong>3</strong> And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.  <strong>4</strong> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.  <strong>5</strong> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.  <strong>6</strong> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.  <strong>7</strong> And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.  <strong>8</strong> Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.  <strong>9</strong> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;  <strong>10</strong> The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.  <strong>12</strong> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:  <strong>13</strong> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,  <strong>14</strong> And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,  <strong>15</strong> Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:  <strong>16</strong> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.  <strong>17</strong> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.  <strong>18</strong> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.  <strong>19</strong> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:  <strong>20</strong> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.  <strong>21</strong> And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was  barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.  <strong>22</strong> And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one  people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.  <strong>24</strong> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  <strong>25</strong> And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.  <strong>26</strong> And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.  <strong>27</strong> And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.  <strong>28</strong> And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.  <strong>29</strong> And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was  faint:  <strong>30</strong> And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.  <strong>31</strong> And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.  <strong>32</strong> And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?  <strong>33</strong> And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.  <strong>34</strong> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Sarah said, \"God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And she added, \"Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and she said to Abraham, \"Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But God said to him, \"Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I will make the son of the maidservant into a nation also, because he is your offspring.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she thought, \"I cannot watch the boy die.\" And as she sat there nearby, she began to sob. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, \"What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, \"God is with you in everything you do. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants.
