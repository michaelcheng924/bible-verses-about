So you will not be able to stand before your enemies. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will devour you. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins; also because of their fathers' sins they will waste away. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"'But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their fathers-their treachery against me and their hostility toward me, <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> which made me hostile toward them so that I sent them into the land of their enemies-then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> For the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them. They will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely, breaking my covenant with them. I am the LORD their God. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But for their sake I will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought out of Egypt in the sight of the nations to be their God. I am the LORD.'\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.
