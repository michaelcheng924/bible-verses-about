He said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed thousands, and what more can he have but the kingdom?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>And Saul eyed David from that day on.</p>\n<p id=\"p09018009_09-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>The next day a harmful spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he raved within his house while David was playing the lyre, as he did day by day. Saul had his spear in his hand. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>And Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.</p>\n<p id=\"p09018011_09-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with him but had departed from Saul. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>So Saul removed him from his presence and made him a commander of a thousand. And he went out and came in before the people. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>And David had success in all his undertakings, for the LORD was with him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And when Saul saw that he had great success, he stood in fearful awe of him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p09018016_12-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said to David, “Here is my elder daughter Merab. I will give her to you for a wife. Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD’s battles.” For Saul thought, “Let not my hand be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>And David said to Saul, “Who am I, and who are my relatives, my father’s clan in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife.</p>\n<p id=\"p09018019_12-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>Now Saul’s daughter Michal loved David.

Now then become the king’s son-in-law.’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>And Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, “Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king’s son-in-law, since I am a poor man and have no reputation?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>And the servants of Saul told him, “Thus and so did David speak.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>Then Saul said, “Thus shall you say to David, ‘The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, that he may be avenged of the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law. Before the time had expired, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>David arose and went, along with his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. And David brought their foreskins, which were given in full number to the king, that he might become the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal for a wife. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>But when Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was David’s enemy continually.</p>\n<p id=\"p09018029_12-15\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09018030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Then the commanders of the Philistines came out to battle, and as often as they came out David had more success than all the servants of Saul, so that his name was highly esteemed.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>3</strong> Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.

And when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>The king sat on his seat, as at other times, on the seat by the wall.

He is not clean; surely he is not clean.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>But on the second day, the day after the new moon, David’s place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>He said, ‘Let me go, for our clan holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there.

Therefore send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>But Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him. So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.</p>\n<p id=\"p09020034_04-9\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little boy. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020036-1\">36&nbsp;</b>And he said to his boy, “Run and find the arrows that I shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020037-1\">37&nbsp;</b>And when the boy came to the place of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is not the arrow beyond you?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020038-1\">38&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!” So Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows and came to his master. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>But the boy knew nothing. Only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020040-1\">40&nbsp;</b>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go and carry them to the city.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020041-1\">41&nbsp;</b>And as soon as the boy had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed one another and wept with one another, David weeping the most. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v09020042-1\">42&nbsp;</b>Then Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my offspring and your offspring, forever.’” And he rose and departed, and Jonathan went into the city.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is  my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?  <strong>2</strong> And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it is not so.  <strong>3</strong> And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step between me and death.  <strong>4</strong> Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do it for thee.  <strong>5</strong> And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even.  <strong>6</strong> If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked leave  of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there is  a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.  <strong>7</strong> If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.  <strong>8</strong> Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?  <strong>9</strong> And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee?  <strong>10</strong> Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if  thy father answer thee roughly?  <strong>11</strong> And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.  <strong>12</strong> And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day,  and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;  <strong>13</strong> The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.  <strong>14</strong> And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:  <strong>15</strong> But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.  <strong>16</strong> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.  <strong>17</strong> And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.  <strong>18</strong> Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.  <strong>19</strong> And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.  <strong>20</strong> And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.  <strong>21</strong> And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.  <strong>22</strong> But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are  beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.  <strong>23</strong> And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.  <strong>24</strong> So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat.  <strong>25</strong> And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.  <strong>26</strong> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?  <strong>28</strong> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem:  <strong>29</strong> And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table.  <strong>30</strong> Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?  <strong>31</strong> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.  <strong>32</strong> And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?  <strong>33</strong> And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.  <strong>34</strong> So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.  <strong>35</strong> And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.  <strong>36</strong> And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.  <strong>37</strong> And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?  <strong>38</strong> And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.  <strong>39</strong> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.  <strong>40</strong> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.  <strong>41</strong>           And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.  <strong>42</strong> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, \"What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?\" <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Never!\" Jonathan replied. \"You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But David took an oath and said, \"Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jonathan said to David, \"Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So David said, \"Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If your father misses me at all, tell him, 'David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> If he says, 'Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Never!\" Jonathan said. \"If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> David asked, \"Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Come,\" Jonathan said, \"let's go out into the field.\" So they went there together. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then Jonathan said to David: \"By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family-not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, \"May the LORD call David's enemies to account.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then Jonathan said to David: \"Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then I will send a boy and say, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And about the matter you and I discussed-remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, \"Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean-surely he is unclean.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, \"Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Jonathan answered, \"David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He said, 'Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, \"You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Why should he be put to death? What has he done?\" Jonathan asked his father. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> and he said to the boy, \"Run and find the arrows I shoot.\" As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, \"Isn't the arrow beyond you?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Then he shouted, \"Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!\" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> (The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.) <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, \"Go, carry them back to town.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together-but David wept the most. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jonathan said to David, \"Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'\" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.

And David avoided out of his presence twice.  <strong>12</strong> And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.  <strong>13</strong> Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.  <strong>14</strong> And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.  <strong>15</strong> Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.  <strong>16</strong> But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.  <strong>17</strong> And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.  <strong>18</strong> And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is  my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?  <strong>19</strong> But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.  <strong>20</strong> And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.  <strong>21</strong> And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.

And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king’s son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?  <strong>24</strong> And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David.  <strong>25</strong> And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.  <strong>26</strong> And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law.

This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> As they danced, they sang: \"Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. \"They have credited David with tens of thousands,\" he thought, \"but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and he hurled it, saying to himself, \"I'll pin David to the wall.\" But David eluded him twice. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left Saul. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> In everything he did he had great success, because the LORD was with him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Saul said to David, \"Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD.\" For Saul said to himself, \"I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But David said to Saul, \"Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"I will give her to him,\" he thought, \"so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\" So Saul said to David, \"Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Saul ordered his attendants: \"Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.'\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> They repeated these words to David. But David said, \"Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Saul's servants told him what David had said, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Saul replied, \"Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'\" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.

And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.  <strong>12</strong> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;  <strong>14</strong> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.  <strong>15</strong> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.  <strong>16</strong> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me  now: and if not, I will take it by force.  <strong>17</strong> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.  <strong>18</strong> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.  <strong>19</strong> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it  to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.  <strong>20</strong> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.  <strong>21</strong> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.  <strong>23</strong> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.  <strong>24</strong> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.  <strong>25</strong> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.  <strong>26</strong> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.  <strong>27</strong> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?  <strong>28</strong> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be  my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?  <strong>29</strong> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that  thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.  <strong>31</strong> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.  <strong>32</strong> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.  <strong>33</strong> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.  <strong>34</strong> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.  <strong>35</strong> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.  <strong>36</strong> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then Hannah prayed and said: \"My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. \"For the foundations of the earth are the LORD's; upon them he has set the world. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. \"It is not by strength that one prevails; <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. \"He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \"Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If the man said to him, \"Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want,\" the servant would then answer, \"No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD's sight, for they were treating the LORD's offering with contempt. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But Samuel was ministering before the LORD -a boy wearing a linen ephod. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, \"May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD.\" Then they would go home. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So he said to them, \"Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD's people. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?\" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD's will to put them to death. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, \"This is what the LORD says: 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?' <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares: 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you-they will both die on the same day. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, \"Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.\"'\" "},{"_id":"615d01b9e4f8ad1e13fa85d4","topicId":"615d01b4e4f8ad1e13fa85c7","verse":"1 Chronicles 2:1-55","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p13002001_05-22\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v13002001-1\">2:1&nbsp;</b>These are the sons of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v13002002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>Dan, Joseph, Benjamin, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v13002003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>The sons of Judah: Er, Onan and Shelah; these three Bath-shua the Canaanite bore to him.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> David again brought together out of Israel chosen men, thirty thousand in all. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He and all his men set out from Baalah of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, the name of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> with the ark of God on it, and Ahio was walking in front of it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all their might before the LORD, with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums and cymbals. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The LORD's anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then David was angry because the LORD's wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, \"How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was not willing to take the ark of the LORD to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and his entire household. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now King David was told, \"The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God.\" So David went down and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When those who were carrying the ark of the LORD had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> while he and the entire house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him in her heart. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the LORD. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, \"How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> David said to Michal, \"It was before the LORD, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the LORD's people Israel-I will celebrate before the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death. "}]}
