Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  <strong>10</strong> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  <strong>11</strong> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  <strong>13</strong> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  <strong>14</strong> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  <strong>15</strong> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  <strong>16</strong> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  <strong>17</strong> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  <strong>18</strong> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are  not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.  <strong>19</strong> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  <strong>20</strong> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  <strong>21</strong> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  <strong>22</strong> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  <strong>23</strong> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  <strong>24</strong> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  <strong>25</strong> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  <strong>26</strong> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  <strong>27</strong> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  <strong>28</strong> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  <strong>29</strong> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  <strong>30</strong> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  <strong>31</strong> What shall we then say to these things?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

And they were offended at him.  <strong>4</strong> But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.  <strong>5</strong> And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.  <strong>6</strong> And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.  <strong>7</strong> And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;  <strong>8</strong> And commanded them that they should take nothing for their  journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their  purse:  <strong>9</strong> But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.  <strong>10</strong> And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.  <strong>11</strong> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.  <strong>12</strong> And they went out, and preached that men should repent.  <strong>13</strong> And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.  <strong>14</strong> And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  <strong>15</strong> Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.  <strong>16</strong> But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.  <strong>17</strong> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.  <strong>18</strong> For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.  <strong>19</strong> Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:  <strong>20</strong> For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.  <strong>21</strong> And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;  <strong>22</strong> And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.  <strong>24</strong> And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.  <strong>25</strong> And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.  <strong>26</strong> And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.  <strong>27</strong> And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,  <strong>28</strong> And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.  <strong>29</strong> And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.  <strong>30</strong> And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.  <strong>31</strong> And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.  <strong>32</strong> And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.  <strong>33</strong> And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.  <strong>34</strong> And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.  <strong>35</strong> And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:  <strong>36</strong> Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?  <strong>38</strong> He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.  <strong>39</strong> And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.  <strong>40</strong> And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.  <strong>41</strong> And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.  <strong>42</strong> And they did all eat, and were filled.  <strong>43</strong> And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.  <strong>44</strong> And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.  <strong>45</strong> And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.  <strong>46</strong> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.  <strong>47</strong> And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.  <strong>48</strong> And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.  <strong>49</strong> But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:  <strong>50</strong> For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.  <strong>51</strong> And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.  <strong>52</strong> For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.  <strong>53</strong> And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.  <strong>54</strong> And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,  <strong>55</strong> And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.  <strong>56</strong> And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Where did this man get these things?\" they asked. \"What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And he was amazed at their lack of faith. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> These were his instructions: \"Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Wear sandals but not an extra tunic. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They went out and preached that people should repent. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said to him, \"That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\" When they found out, they said, \"Five--and two fish.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They all ate and were satisfied, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> because they all saw him and were terrified. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This is what the ancients were commended for. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
