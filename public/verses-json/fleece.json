And the people of Israel cried out for help to the LORD.</p>\n<p id=\"p07006006_04-16\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>When the people of Israel cried out to the LORD on account of the Midianites, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006009-1\">9&nbsp;</b>And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>And I said to you, ‘I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell.’ But you have not obeyed my voice.”</p>\n\n<p id=\"p07006010_08-16\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, “The LORD is with you, O mighty man of valor.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>And Gideon said to him, “Please, my lord, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>And the LORD turned to him and said, “Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>And the LORD said to him, “But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>And he said to him, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you.” And he said, “I will stay till you return.”</p>\n<p id=\"p07006018_08-16\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>And the angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them.” And he did so. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD. And Gideon said, “Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>But the LORD said to him, “Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and called it, The LORD Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites.</p>\n<p id=\"p07006024_08-16\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>That night the LORD said to him, “Take your father’s bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the LORD had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p07006027_14-16\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>And they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” And after they had searched and inquired, they said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>Then the men of the town said to Joash, “Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, “Let Baal contend against him,” because he broke down his altar.</p>\n<p id=\"p07006032_14-16\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>But the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him.

When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07006039-1\">39&nbsp;</b>Then Gideon said to God, “Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more.

that they might obtain a better resurrection:  <strong>36</strong> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  <strong>37</strong> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  <strong>38</strong> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  <strong>39</strong> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  <strong>40</strong> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This is what the ancients were commended for. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.  <strong>19</strong> And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.  <strong>20</strong> And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.  <strong>21</strong> Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.  <strong>22</strong> And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.  <strong>23</strong> And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.  <strong>24</strong> Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites.  <strong>25</strong> And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:  <strong>26</strong> And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.  <strong>27</strong> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.  <strong>28</strong> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was  by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was  built.  <strong>29</strong> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.  <strong>30</strong> Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.  <strong>31</strong> And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.  <strong>32</strong> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.  <strong>33</strong> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.  <strong>34</strong> But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abi-ezer was gathered after him.  <strong>35</strong> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.  <strong>36</strong> And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,  <strong>37</strong> Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.  <strong>38</strong> And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.  <strong>39</strong> And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.  <strong>40</strong> And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the Israelites cried to the LORD because of Midian, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> he sent them a prophet, who said, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, \"The LORD is with you, mighty warrior.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"But sir,\" Gideon replied, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"But Lord, \"Gideon asked, \"how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The LORD answered, \"I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Gideon replied, \"If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.\" And the LORD said, \"I will wait until you return.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.\" And Gideon did so. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, \"Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But the LORD said to him, \"Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> That same night the LORD said to him, \"Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar! <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They asked each other, \"Who did this?\" When they carefully investigated, they were told, \"Gideon son of Joash did it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The men of the town demanded of Joash, \"Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, \"Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So that day they called Gideon \"Jerub-Baal, \"saying, \"Let Baal contend with him,\" because he broke down Baal's altar. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Gideon said to God, \"If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised- <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew-a bowlful of water. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Gideon said to God, \"Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.

And Sarah heard it  in the tent door, which was behind him.  <strong>11</strong> Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  <strong>13</strong> And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?  <strong>14</strong> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.  <strong>15</strong> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.  <strong>16</strong> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.  <strong>17</strong> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;  <strong>18</strong> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?  <strong>19</strong> For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.  <strong>20</strong> And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;  <strong>21</strong> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.  <strong>22</strong> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?  <strong>24</strong> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are  therein?  <strong>25</strong> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  <strong>26</strong> And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:  <strong>28</strong> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.  <strong>29</strong> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.  <strong>30</strong> And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.

And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.  <strong>10</strong> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.  <strong>11</strong> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  <strong>12</strong> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:  <strong>13</strong> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.  <strong>14</strong> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.  <strong>15</strong> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.  <strong>16</strong> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.  <strong>17</strong> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.  <strong>18</strong> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:  <strong>19</strong> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:  <strong>20</strong> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.  <strong>21</strong> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.  <strong>22</strong> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.  <strong>23</strong> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.  <strong>24</strong> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;  <strong>25</strong> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.  <strong>26</strong> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.  <strong>27</strong> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:  <strong>28</strong> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.  <strong>30</strong> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.  <strong>31</strong> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:  <strong>32</strong> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>33</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>34</strong> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.  <strong>35</strong> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  <strong>36</strong> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.  <strong>37</strong> And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.  <strong>38</strong> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He said, \"If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way-now that you have come to your servant.Very well,\" they answered, \"do as you say.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. \"Quick,\" he said, \"get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Where is your wife Sarah?\" they asked him. \"There, in the tent,\" he said. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.\" Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, \"After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Abraham, \"Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?' <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, \"I did not laugh.\" But he said, \"Yes, you did laugh.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.\" "},{"_id":"6161af7fc0307ca401cc463c","topicId":"6161af78c0307ca401cc4624","verse":"Genesis 1:1-31","votes":2,"__v":0,"kjv":"<strong>1</strong> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  <strong>2</strong> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was  upon the face of the deep.
