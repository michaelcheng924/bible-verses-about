Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.  <strong>7</strong> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.  <strong>8</strong> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  <strong>9</strong> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.  <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.  <strong>11</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?  <strong>12</strong> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  <strong>13</strong> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:  <strong>14</strong> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.  <strong>15</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.  <strong>16</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.  <strong>17</strong> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:  <strong>18</strong> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.  <strong>19</strong> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.  <strong>20</strong> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.  <strong>21</strong> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.  <strong>22</strong> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.  <strong>23</strong> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.  <strong>24</strong> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.  <strong>25</strong> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.  <strong>26</strong> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. <strong>27</strong> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?  <strong>28</strong> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,  <strong>29</strong> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?  <strong>30</strong> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.  <strong>31</strong> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.  <strong>32</strong> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.  <strong>35</strong> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.  <strong>36</strong> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.  <strong>37</strong> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.  <strong>38</strong> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. <strong>39</strong> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.  <strong>40</strong> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.  <strong>41</strong> And many more believed because of his own word;  <strong>42</strong> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.  <strong>43</strong> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.  <strong>44</strong> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.  <strong>45</strong> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.  <strong>46</strong> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.  <strong>47</strong> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.  <strong>48</strong> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.  <strong>49</strong> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.  <strong>51</strong> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him,  saying, Thy son liveth.  <strong>52</strong> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.  <strong>53</strong> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.  <strong>54</strong> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Now he had to go through Samaria. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \"Will you give me a drink?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ) <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I have no husband,\" she replied. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus declared, \"Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They came out of the town and made their way toward him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Meanwhile his disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat something.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And because of his words many more became believers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the two days he left for Galilee. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" The man took Jesus at his word and departed. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and all his household believed. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.
