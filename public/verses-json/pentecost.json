And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.  <strong>3</strong> And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.  <strong>4</strong> Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.  <strong>5</strong> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.  <strong>6</strong> And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.  <strong>7</strong> And all the men were about twelve.  <strong>8</strong> And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.  <strong>9</strong> But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.  <strong>10</strong> And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.  <strong>11</strong> And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:  <strong>12</strong> So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.  <strong>13</strong> Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.  <strong>14</strong> And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and  chief of the priests, which did so.  <strong>15</strong> And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?  <strong>16</strong> And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.  <strong>17</strong> And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  <strong>18</strong> And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.  <strong>19</strong> Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.  <strong>20</strong> So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.  <strong>21</strong> After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.  <strong>22</strong> So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.  <strong>23</strong> And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.  <strong>24</strong> For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;  <strong>25</strong> Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.  <strong>26</strong> Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:  <strong>27</strong> So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.  <strong>28</strong> And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  <strong>29</strong> And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.  <strong>30</strong> And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.  <strong>31</strong> And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.  <strong>32</strong> Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.  <strong>33</strong> And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.  <strong>34</strong> But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.  <strong>35</strong> And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye  men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?  <strong>36</strong> Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.  <strong>37</strong> For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.  <strong>38</strong> Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.  <strong>39</strong> But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.  <strong>40</strong> For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.  <strong>41</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and asked them, \"Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\" They answered, \"No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Paul asked, \"Then what baptism did you receive?John's baptism,\" they replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Paul said, \"John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> There were about twelve men in all. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, \"In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> One day the evil spirit answered them, \"Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. \"After I have been there,\" he said, \"I must visit Rome also.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: \"Men, you know we receive a good income from this business. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The city clerk quieted the crowd and said: \"Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.

 <strong>7</strong> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.  <strong>8</strong> But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.  <strong>9</strong> And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.  <strong>10</strong> And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;  <strong>11</strong> Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.  <strong>12</strong> Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.  <strong>13</strong> And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.  <strong>14</strong> These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.  <strong>15</strong> And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)  <strong>16</strong> Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.  <strong>17</strong> For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.  <strong>18</strong> Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.  <strong>19</strong> And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.  <strong>20</strong> For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.  <strong>21</strong> Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,  <strong>22</strong> Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.  <strong>23</strong> And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.  <strong>24</strong> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,  <strong>25</strong> That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.  <strong>26</strong> And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: \"Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So when they met together, they asked him, \"Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He said to them: \"It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Men of Galilee,\" they said, \"why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty) <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and said, \"Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus-- <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> he was one of our number and shared in this ministry.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.) <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"For,\" said Peter, \"it is written in the book of Psalms, \"'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, \"'May another take his place of leadership.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then they prayed, \"Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
