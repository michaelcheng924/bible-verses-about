Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

but the LORD weigheth the spirits.  <strong>3</strong> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.  <strong>4</strong> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.  <strong>5</strong> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.  <strong>6</strong> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.  <strong>7</strong> When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.  <strong>8</strong> Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.  <strong>9</strong> A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.  <strong>10</strong> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.  <strong>11</strong> A just weight and balance are the LORD’S: all the weights of the bag are his work.  <strong>12</strong> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.  <strong>13</strong> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.  <strong>14</strong> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.  <strong>15</strong> In the light of the king’s countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.  <strong>16</strong> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!  <strong>17</strong> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.  <strong>18</strong> Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.  <strong>19</strong> Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.  <strong>20</strong> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.  <strong>21</strong> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.  <strong>22</strong> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.  <strong>23</strong> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.  <strong>24</strong> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.  <strong>25</strong> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.  <strong>26</strong> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.  <strong>27</strong> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is  as a burning fire.  <strong>28</strong> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.  <strong>29</strong> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.  <strong>30</strong> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.  <strong>31</strong> The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.  <strong>33</strong> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.  <strong>2</strong> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.  <strong>3</strong> The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.  <strong>4</strong> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.  <strong>5</strong> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.  <strong>6</strong> Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.  <strong>7</strong> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.  <strong>8</strong> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.  <strong>9</strong> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.  <strong>10</strong> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.  <strong>11</strong> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.  <strong>12</strong> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.  <strong>13</strong> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.  <strong>14</strong> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.  <strong>15</strong> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?  <strong>17</strong> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.  <strong>18</strong> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.  <strong>19</strong> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.  <strong>20</strong> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.  <strong>21</strong> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.  <strong>22</strong> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.  <strong>23</strong> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.  <strong>24</strong> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.  <strong>25</strong> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.  <strong>26</strong> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.  <strong>27</strong> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.  <strong>28</strong> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and  he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.  <strong>1</strong> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and  intermeddleth with all wisdom.  <strong>2</strong> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.  <strong>3</strong> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.  <strong>4</strong> The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and  the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.  <strong>5</strong> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.  <strong>6</strong> A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.  <strong>7</strong> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are  the snare of his soul.  <strong>8</strong> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.  <strong>9</strong> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.  <strong>10</strong> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.  <strong>11</strong> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.  <strong>12</strong> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.  <strong>13</strong> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.  <strong>14</strong> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?  <strong>15</strong> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.  <strong>16</strong> A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  <strong>17</strong> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  <strong>18</strong> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.  <strong>19</strong> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.  <strong>20</strong> A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  <strong>21</strong> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.  <strong>22</strong> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  <strong>24</strong> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.  <strong>1</strong> Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.  <strong>2</strong> Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is  not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.  <strong>3</strong> The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.  <strong>4</strong> Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.  <strong>5</strong> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.  <strong>6</strong> Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is  a friend to him that giveth gifts.  <strong>7</strong> All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.  <strong>8</strong> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.  <strong>9</strong> A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.  <strong>10</strong> Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.  <strong>11</strong> The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.  <strong>12</strong> The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.  <strong>13</strong> A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.  <strong>14</strong> House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the LORD.  <strong>15</strong> Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.  <strong>16</strong> He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but  he that despiseth his ways shall die.  <strong>17</strong> He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.  <strong>18</strong> Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.  <strong>19</strong> A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.  <strong>20</strong> Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.  <strong>21</strong> There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.  <strong>22</strong> The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.  <strong>23</strong> The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.  <strong>24</strong> A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.  <strong>25</strong> Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.  <strong>26</strong> He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.  <strong>27</strong> Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.  <strong>28</strong> An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.  <strong>29</strong> Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.  <strong>1</strong> Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.  <strong>2</strong> The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso  provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.  <strong>3</strong> It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.  <strong>4</strong> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore  shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.  <strong>5</strong> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.  <strong>6</strong> Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?  <strong>7</strong> The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are  blessed after him.  <strong>8</strong> A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.  <strong>9</strong> Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?  <strong>10</strong> Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are  alike abomination to the LORD.  <strong>11</strong> Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be  pure, and whether it be right.  <strong>12</strong> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.  <strong>13</strong> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and  thou shalt be satisfied with bread.  <strong>14</strong> It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.  <strong>15</strong> There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.  <strong>16</strong> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.  <strong>17</strong> Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.  <strong>18</strong> Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.  <strong>19</strong> He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.  <strong>20</strong> Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.  <strong>21</strong> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.  <strong>22</strong> Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.  <strong>23</strong> Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.  <strong>24</strong> Man’s goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?  <strong>25</strong> It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.  <strong>26</strong> A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.  <strong>27</strong> The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.  <strong>28</strong> Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.  <strong>29</strong> The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the grey head.  <strong>30</strong> The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> To man belong the plans of the heart, but from the LORD comes the reply of the tongue. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the LORD. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and your plans will succeed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The LORD works out everything for his own ends- even the wicked for a day of disaster. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD detests all the proud of heart.
