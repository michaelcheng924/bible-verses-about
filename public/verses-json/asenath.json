Then Pharaoh woke up. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He fell asleep again and had a second dream: Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted-thin and scorched by the east wind. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, \"Today I am reminded of my shortcomings. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"I cannot do it,\" Joseph replied to Pharaoh, \"but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After them, seven other cows came up-scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After them, seven other heads sprouted-withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, \"The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind: They are seven years of famine. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So Pharaoh asked them, \"Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> So Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and men shouted before him, \"Make way!\" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout Egypt. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, \"It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> The second son he named Ephraim and said, \"It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end, <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, \"Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the world.

To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They will say, \"Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.  <strong>6</strong> And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,  <strong>7</strong> Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.  <strong>8</strong> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.  <strong>9</strong> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth:  <strong>10</strong> And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.  <strong>11</strong> And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:  <strong>12</strong> My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.  <strong>13</strong> And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.  <strong>14</strong> And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.  <strong>15</strong> And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:  <strong>16</strong> And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:  <strong>17</strong> And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.  <strong>18</strong> And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?  <strong>19</strong> And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.  <strong>20</strong> And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.  <strong>21</strong> And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.  <strong>22</strong> And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.  <strong>23</strong> And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.  <strong>24</strong> And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.  <strong>25</strong> And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.  <strong>26</strong> And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.  <strong>27</strong> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is  as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:  <strong>28</strong> Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:  <strong>29</strong> Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be  every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.  <strong>31</strong> And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.  <strong>32</strong> And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.  <strong>33</strong> And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is  he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and  he shall be blessed.  <strong>34</strong> And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even  me also, O my father.  <strong>35</strong> And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.  <strong>36</strong> And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?  <strong>37</strong> And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  <strong>38</strong> And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.  <strong>39</strong> And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;  <strong>40</strong> And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.  <strong>41</strong> And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.  <strong>42</strong> And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.  <strong>43</strong> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;  <strong>44</strong> And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn away;  <strong>45</strong> Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that  which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?  <strong>46</strong> And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, \"My son.Here I am,\" he answered. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Isaac said, \"I am now an old man and don't know the day of my death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now then, get your weapons-your quiver and bow-and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Rebekah said to her son Jacob, \"Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, \"But my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I'm a man with smooth skin. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> His mother said to him, \"My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He went to his father and said, \"My father.Yes, my son,\" he answered. \"Who is it?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jacob said to his father, \"I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Isaac asked his son, \"How did you find it so quickly, my son?The LORD your God gave me success,\" he replied. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then Isaac said to Jacob, \"Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, \"The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Are you really my son Esau?\" he asked. \"I am,\" he replied. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then he said, \"My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.\" Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then his father Isaac said to him, \"Come here, my son, and kiss me.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, \"Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness- an abundance of grain and new wine. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, \"My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> His father Isaac asked him, \"Who are you?I am your son,\" he answered, \"your firstborn, Esau.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Isaac trembled violently and said, \"Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him-and indeed he will be blessed!\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, \"Bless me-me too, my father!\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But he said, \"Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Esau said, \"Isn't he rightly named Jacob? He has deceived me these two times: He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!\" Then he asked, \"Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Isaac answered Esau, \"I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Esau said to his father, \"Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!\" Then Esau wept aloud. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> His father Isaac answered him, \"Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, \"The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, \"Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then Rebekah said to Isaac, \"I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.\" "},{"_id":"6158f9de2ee2ce61bea42c63","topicId":"6158f9d82ee2ce61bea42c4f","verse":"Genesis 21:1-34","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p01021001_05-20\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v01021001-1\">21:1&nbsp;</b>The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01021002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01021003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01021004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01021005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01021006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v01021007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children?

Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.
