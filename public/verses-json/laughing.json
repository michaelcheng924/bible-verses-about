It read:|sc JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, \"Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Pilate answered, \"What I have written, I have written.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Let's not tear it,\" they said to one another. \"Let's decide by lot who will get it.\" This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, \"They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing.\" So this is what the soldiers did. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \"Dear woman, here is your son,\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> and to the disciple, \"Here is your mother.\" From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
