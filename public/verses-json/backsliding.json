If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.  <strong>4</strong> Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.  <strong>5</strong> He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.  <strong>6</strong> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <strong>7</strong>           And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write;

behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.  <strong>10</strong> Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.  <strong>12</strong> Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him  my new name.  <strong>13</strong> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <strong>14</strong>           And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;  <strong>15</strong> I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.  <strong>16</strong> So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.  <strong>17</strong> Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:  <strong>18</strong> I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that  the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.  <strong>19</strong> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.  <strong>20</strong> Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.  <strong>21</strong> To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.  <strong>22</strong> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. <strong>1</strong> After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.  <strong>2</strong> And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.  <strong>3</strong> And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.  <strong>4</strong> And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.  <strong>5</strong> And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.  <strong>6</strong> And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.  <strong>7</strong> And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.  <strong>8</strong> And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him;  and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.  <strong>9</strong> And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,  <strong>10</strong> The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,  <strong>11</strong> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.
