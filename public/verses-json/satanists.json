<strong>11</strong> Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.  <strong>12</strong> How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!  <strong>13</strong> For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:  <strong>14</strong> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.  <strong>15</strong> Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.  <strong>16</strong> They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms;  <strong>17</strong> That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?  <strong>18</strong> All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house.  <strong>19</strong> But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.  <strong>20</strong> Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned.  <strong>21</strong> Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.  <strong>22</strong> For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.  <strong>24</strong> The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:  <strong>25</strong> That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.  <strong>26</strong> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.  <strong>27</strong> For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it?  and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?  <strong>28</strong> In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.  <strong>29</strong> Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.  <strong>30</strong> And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.  <strong>31</strong> Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.  <strong>32</strong> What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
