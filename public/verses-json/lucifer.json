So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> By your many sins and dishonest trade you have desecrated your sanctuaries. So I made a fire come out from you, and it consumed you, and I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> All the nations who knew you are appalled at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The word of the LORD came to me: <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Son of man, set your face against Sidon; prophesy against her <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> and say: 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"'I am against you, O Sidon, and I will gain glory within you.

The slain will fall within her, with the sword against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"'No longer will the people of Israel have malicious neighbors who are painful briers and sharp thorns.

His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety.
