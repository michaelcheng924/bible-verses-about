And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.  <strong>7</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.  <strong>8</strong> And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.  <strong>9</strong> And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God.  <strong>10</strong> And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is  among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.  <strong>11</strong> Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.  <strong>12</strong> Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.  <strong>13</strong> And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;  <strong>15</strong> And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)  <strong>16</strong> That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.  <strong>17</strong> And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,  <strong>2</strong> Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,  <strong>3</strong> And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.  <strong>4</strong> Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:  <strong>5</strong> And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:  <strong>6</strong> That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  <strong>7</strong> Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.  <strong>8</strong> And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.  <strong>9</strong> And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.  <strong>10</strong> For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.  <strong>12</strong> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:  <strong>13</strong> About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.  <strong>14</strong> On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.  <strong>15</strong> And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,  <strong>16</strong> Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.  <strong>17</strong> Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.  <strong>18</strong> And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.  <strong>19</strong> And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.  <strong>20</strong> And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.  <strong>21</strong> And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones?  <strong>22</strong> Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.  <strong>23</strong> For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:  <strong>24</strong> That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.  <strong>2</strong> At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.  <strong>3</strong> And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.  <strong>4</strong> And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.  <strong>5</strong> Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.  <strong>6</strong> For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.  <strong>7</strong> And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.  <strong>10</strong> And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.  <strong>11</strong> And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.  <strong>12</strong> And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.  <strong>13</strong> And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  <strong>14</strong> And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?  <strong>15</strong> And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.  <strong>1</strong> Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.  <strong>2</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.  <strong>3</strong> And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and  go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.  <strong>4</strong> And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.  <strong>5</strong> And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast  with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.  <strong>6</strong> And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.  <strong>7</strong> And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.  <strong>8</strong> And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.  <strong>9</strong> And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.  <strong>10</strong> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.  <strong>11</strong> So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it  once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.  <strong>12</strong> And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.  <strong>13</strong> And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.  <strong>14</strong> And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.  <strong>15</strong> And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city.  <strong>17</strong> And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.  <strong>18</strong> And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.  <strong>19</strong> But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are  consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.  <strong>20</strong> So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.  <strong>21</strong> And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.  <strong>22</strong> But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.  <strong>23</strong> And the young men that were spies went in, and brought Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.  <strong>24</strong> And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.  <strong>25</strong> And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.  <strong>26</strong> And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.  <strong>27</strong> So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.  <strong>1</strong> But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.  <strong>2</strong> And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.  <strong>3</strong> And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; and  make not all the people to labour thither; for they are but  few.  <strong>4</strong> So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.  <strong>5</strong> And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.  <strong>6</strong> And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.  <strong>7</strong> And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!  <strong>8</strong> O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!  <strong>9</strong> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?  <strong>10</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?  <strong>11</strong> Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.  <strong>13</strong> Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.  <strong>14</strong> In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.  <strong>15</strong> And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.  <strong>16</strong> So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:  <strong>17</strong> And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:  <strong>18</strong> And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.  <strong>19</strong> And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.  <strong>20</strong> And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:  <strong>21</strong> When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.  <strong>22</strong> So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.  <strong>23</strong> And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD.  <strong>24</strong> And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.  <strong>25</strong> And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.  <strong>26</strong> And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.  <strong>1</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:  <strong>2</strong> And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.  <strong>3</strong> So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.  <strong>4</strong> And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:  <strong>5</strong> And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,  <strong>6</strong> (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.  <strong>7</strong> Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.  <strong>8</strong> And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.  <strong>9</strong> Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.  <strong>10</strong> And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  <strong>11</strong> And all the people, even the people of war that were  with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.  <strong>12</strong> And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.  <strong>13</strong> And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.  <strong>16</strong> And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.  <strong>17</strong> And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is  in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.  <strong>19</strong> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.  <strong>20</strong> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.  <strong>21</strong> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.  <strong>22</strong> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.  <strong>23</strong> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.  <strong>24</strong> And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.  <strong>25</strong> And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.  <strong>26</strong> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  <strong>27</strong> Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.  <strong>28</strong> And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.  <strong>29</strong> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,  <strong>31</strong> As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.  <strong>32</strong> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  <strong>33</strong> And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.  <strong>34</strong> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  <strong>35</strong> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;  <strong>2</strong> That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.  <strong>3</strong> And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,  <strong>4</strong> They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;  <strong>5</strong> And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.  <strong>6</strong> And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.  <strong>7</strong> And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?  <strong>8</strong> And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?  <strong>9</strong> And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,  <strong>10</strong> And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were  beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.  <strong>11</strong> Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.  <strong>12</strong> This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:  <strong>13</strong> And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.  <strong>14</strong> And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel  at the mouth of the LORD.  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.  <strong>16</strong> And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.  <strong>17</strong> And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.  <strong>18</strong> And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.  <strong>19</strong> But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.  <strong>20</strong> This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.  <strong>21</strong> And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.  <strong>22</strong> And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?  <strong>23</strong> Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.  <strong>24</strong> And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.  <strong>25</strong> And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.  <strong>26</strong> And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.  <strong>27</strong> And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.  <strong>1</strong> Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;  <strong>2</strong> That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.  <strong>3</strong> Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,  <strong>4</strong> Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.  <strong>5</strong> Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.  <strong>6</strong> And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.  <strong>7</strong> So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.  <strong>8</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.  <strong>9</strong> Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.  <strong>10</strong> And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.  <strong>11</strong> And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and  were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were  more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.  <strong>12</strong> Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.  <strong>13</strong> And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.  <strong>14</strong> And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.  <strong>16</strong> But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.  <strong>17</strong> And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.  <strong>18</strong> And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:  <strong>19</strong> And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.  <strong>20</strong> And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.  <strong>21</strong> And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.  <strong>22</strong> Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.  <strong>23</strong> And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.  <strong>24</strong> And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.  <strong>25</strong> And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.  <strong>26</strong> And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.  <strong>27</strong> And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.  <strong>28</strong> And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.  <strong>29</strong> Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:  <strong>30</strong> And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.  <strong>31</strong> And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:  <strong>32</strong> And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.  <strong>33</strong> Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.  <strong>34</strong> And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:  <strong>35</strong> And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.  <strong>36</strong> And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:  <strong>37</strong> And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were  therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.  <strong>38</strong> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:  <strong>39</strong> And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.  <strong>40</strong> So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.  <strong>41</strong> And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.  <strong>42</strong> And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.  <strong>43</strong> And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,  <strong>2</strong> And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,  <strong>3</strong> And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.  <strong>4</strong> And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.  <strong>5</strong> And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.  <strong>6</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.  <strong>7</strong> So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.  <strong>8</strong> And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.  <strong>9</strong> And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.  <strong>10</strong> And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.  <strong>11</strong> And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.  <strong>12</strong> And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.  <strong>13</strong> But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.  <strong>14</strong> And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.  <strong>15</strong> As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>16</strong> So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;  <strong>17</strong> Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.  <strong>18</strong> Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.  <strong>19</strong> There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other they took in battle.  <strong>20</strong> For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and  that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.  <strong>21</strong> And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.  <strong>22</strong> There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.  <strong>23</strong> So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.  <strong>1</strong> Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:  <strong>2</strong> Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;  <strong>3</strong> And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way to Beth-jeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdoth-pisgah:  <strong>4</strong> And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,  <strong>5</strong> And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.  <strong>6</strong> Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.  <strong>7</strong> And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;  <strong>8</strong> In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:  <strong>9</strong> The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;  <strong>10</strong> The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;  <strong>11</strong> The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;  <strong>12</strong> The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;  <strong>13</strong> The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;  <strong>14</strong> The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;  <strong>15</strong> The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;  <strong>16</strong> The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;  <strong>17</strong> The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;  <strong>18</strong> The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;  <strong>19</strong> The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;  <strong>20</strong> The king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;  <strong>21</strong> The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;  <strong>22</strong> The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;  <strong>23</strong> The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;  <strong>24</strong> The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.  <strong>1</strong> Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.  <strong>2</strong> This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,  <strong>3</strong> From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:  <strong>4</strong> From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:  <strong>5</strong> And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baal-gad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.  <strong>6</strong> All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.  <strong>7</strong> Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,  <strong>8</strong> With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;  <strong>9</strong> From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;  <strong>10</strong> And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;  <strong>11</strong> And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;  <strong>12</strong> All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out.  <strong>13</strong> Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.  <strong>14</strong> Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them.  <strong>15</strong> And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance  according to their families.  <strong>16</strong> And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba;  <strong>17</strong> Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and Bamoth-baal, and Beth-baal-meon,  <strong>18</strong> And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,  <strong>19</strong> And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zareth-shahar in the mount of the valley,  <strong>20</strong> And Beth-peor, and Ashdoth-pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth,  <strong>21</strong> And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were  dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.  <strong>22</strong> Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them.  <strong>23</strong> And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof.  <strong>24</strong> And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even  unto the children of Gad according to their families.  <strong>25</strong> And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah;  <strong>26</strong> And from Heshbon unto Ramath-mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;  <strong>27</strong> And in the valley, Beth-aram, and Beth-nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and his  border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.  <strong>28</strong> This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages.  <strong>29</strong> And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families.  <strong>30</strong> And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, threescore cities:  <strong>31</strong> And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the children of Machir by their families.  <strong>32</strong> These are the countries which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward.  <strong>33</strong> But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them.  <strong>1</strong> And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.  <strong>2</strong> By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.  <strong>3</strong> For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.  <strong>4</strong> For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.  <strong>5</strong> As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.  <strong>6</strong> Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.  <strong>7</strong> Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.  <strong>8</strong> Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.  <strong>9</strong> And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children’s for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.  <strong>10</strong> And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.  <strong>11</strong> As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is  my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.  <strong>12</strong> Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.  <strong>13</strong> And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.  <strong>14</strong> Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>15</strong> And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.  <strong>1</strong>           This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.  <strong>2</strong> And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:  <strong>3</strong> And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:  <strong>4</strong> From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.  <strong>5</strong> And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was  from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:  <strong>6</strong> And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:  <strong>7</strong> And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of En-shemesh, and the goings out thereof were at En-rogel:  <strong>8</strong> And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:  <strong>9</strong> And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim:  <strong>10</strong> And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:  <strong>11</strong> And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.  <strong>12</strong> And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.  <strong>13</strong> And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even  the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.  <strong>14</strong> And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.  <strong>15</strong> And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.  <strong>16</strong> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.  <strong>17</strong> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.  <strong>18</strong> And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?  <strong>19</strong> Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.  <strong>20</strong> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.  <strong>21</strong> And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,  <strong>22</strong> And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,  <strong>23</strong> And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,  <strong>24</strong> Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,  <strong>25</strong> And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,  <strong>26</strong> Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,  <strong>27</strong> And Hazar-gaddah, and Heshmon, and Beth-palet,  <strong>28</strong> And Hazar-shual, and Beer-sheba, and Bizjothjah,  <strong>29</strong> Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,  <strong>30</strong> And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,  <strong>31</strong> And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,  <strong>32</strong> And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities are twenty and nine, with their villages:  <strong>33</strong> And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,  <strong>34</strong> And Zanoah, and En-gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,  <strong>35</strong> Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,  <strong>36</strong> And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages:  <strong>37</strong> Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdal-gad,  <strong>38</strong> And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,  <strong>39</strong> Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,  <strong>40</strong> And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,  <strong>41</strong> And Gederoth, Beth-dagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages:  <strong>42</strong> Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,  <strong>43</strong> And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,  <strong>44</strong> And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages:  <strong>45</strong> Ekron, with her towns and her villages:  <strong>46</strong> From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages:  <strong>47</strong> Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border thereof: <strong>48</strong> And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,  <strong>49</strong> And Dannah, and Kirjath-sannah, which is Debir,  <strong>50</strong> And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,  <strong>51</strong> And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:  <strong>52</strong> Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,  <strong>53</strong> And Janum, and Beth-tappuah, and Aphekah,  <strong>54</strong> And Humtah, and Kirjath-arba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine cities with their villages:  <strong>55</strong> Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,  <strong>56</strong> And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,  <strong>57</strong> Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:  <strong>58</strong> Halhul, Beth-zur, and Gedor,  <strong>59</strong> And Maarath, and Beth-anoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their villages:  <strong>60</strong> Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, and Rabbah; two cities with their villages:  <strong>61</strong> In the wilderness, Beth-arabah, Middin, and Secacah,  <strong>62</strong> And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi; six cities with their villages.  <strong>63</strong> As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not drive them out: but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.  <strong>1</strong> And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,  <strong>2</strong> And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the borders of Archi to Ataroth,  <strong>3</strong> And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the coast of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gezer: and the goings out thereof are at the sea.  <strong>4</strong> So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.  <strong>5</strong> And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;  <strong>6</strong> And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;  <strong>7</strong> And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.  <strong>8</strong> The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.  <strong>9</strong> And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.  <strong>10</strong> And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.  <strong>1</strong> There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was  the firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.  <strong>2</strong> There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these were  the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.  <strong>3</strong> But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are  the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.  <strong>4</strong> And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father.  <strong>5</strong> And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;  <strong>6</strong> Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.  <strong>7</strong> And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that lieth  before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.  <strong>8</strong> Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;  <strong>9</strong> And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:  <strong>10</strong> Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was  Manasseh’s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.  <strong>11</strong> And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.  <strong>12</strong> Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.  <strong>13</strong> Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.  <strong>14</strong> And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.  <strong>16</strong> And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Beth-shean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.  <strong>17</strong> And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot only:  <strong>18</strong> But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.

And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.  <strong>14</strong> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.  <strong>15</strong> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that  all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.  <strong>18</strong> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.  <strong>19</strong> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.  <strong>20</strong> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,  say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  <strong>21</strong> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  <strong>22</strong> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  <strong>23</strong> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.  <strong>24</strong> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.  <strong>25</strong> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.  <strong>26</strong> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.  <strong>27</strong> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  <strong>28</strong> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <strong>29</strong> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.  <strong>30</strong> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.  <strong>31</strong> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.  <strong>32</strong> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.  <strong>33</strong> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.  <strong>34</strong> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  <strong>35</strong> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.  <strong>36</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.  <strong>37</strong> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.  <strong>38</strong> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.  <strong>39</strong> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.  <strong>40</strong> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  <strong>41</strong> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  <strong>42</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.  <strong>43</strong> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?  <strong>44</strong> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  <strong>45</strong> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.  <strong>46</strong> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.  <strong>1</strong> And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.  <strong>2</strong> Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.  <strong>3</strong> And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.  <strong>4</strong> And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was  the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.  <strong>5</strong> In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.  <strong>6</strong> And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is  this day.  <strong>7</strong> And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how  to go out or come in.  <strong>8</strong> And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.  <strong>9</strong> Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?  <strong>10</strong> And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.  <strong>11</strong> And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;  <strong>12</strong> Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.  <strong>13</strong> And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.  <strong>14</strong> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.  <strong>15</strong> And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.  <strong>16</strong> Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.  <strong>17</strong> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.  <strong>18</strong> And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was  no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.  <strong>19</strong> And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it.  <strong>20</strong> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.  <strong>21</strong> And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.  <strong>22</strong> And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is  thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.  <strong>23</strong> Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.  <strong>24</strong> And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.  <strong>25</strong> And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.  <strong>26</strong> Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.  <strong>27</strong> Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.  <strong>28</strong> And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.  <strong>1</strong> So king Solomon was king over all Israel.  <strong>2</strong> And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest,  <strong>3</strong> Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.  <strong>4</strong> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:  <strong>5</strong> And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king’s friend:  <strong>6</strong> And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.  <strong>7</strong> And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision.  <strong>8</strong> And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:  <strong>9</strong> The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan:  <strong>10</strong> The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all the land of Hepher:  <strong>11</strong> The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:  <strong>12</strong> Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:  <strong>13</strong> The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars:  <strong>14</strong> Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:  <strong>15</strong> Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon to wife:  <strong>16</strong> Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:  <strong>17</strong> Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:  <strong>18</strong> Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:  <strong>19</strong> Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in  the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.  <strong>20</strong> Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is  by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.  <strong>21</strong> And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.  <strong>22</strong> And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,  <strong>23</strong> Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.  <strong>24</strong> For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.  <strong>25</strong> And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.  <strong>26</strong> And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.  <strong>27</strong> And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing.  <strong>28</strong> Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his charge.  <strong>29</strong> And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.  <strong>30</strong> And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.  <strong>31</strong> For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round about.  <strong>32</strong> And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.  <strong>33</strong> And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.  <strong>34</strong> And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.  <strong>1</strong> And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.  <strong>2</strong> And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,  <strong>3</strong> Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.  <strong>4</strong> But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.  <strong>5</strong> And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.  <strong>6</strong> Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.  <strong>7</strong> And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.  <strong>8</strong> And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.  <strong>9</strong> My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.  <strong>10</strong> So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to  all his desire.  <strong>11</strong> And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for  food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.  <strong>12</strong> And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.  <strong>13</strong> And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.  <strong>14</strong> And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.  <strong>15</strong> And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;  <strong>16</strong> Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.  <strong>17</strong> And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.  <strong>18</strong> And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them,  and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,  and the height thereof thirty cubits.  <strong>3</strong> And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was  the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and  ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.  <strong>4</strong> And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.  <strong>5</strong> And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:  <strong>6</strong> The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.  <strong>7</strong> And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.  <strong>8</strong> The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,  and out of the middle into the third.  <strong>9</strong> So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.  <strong>10</strong> And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.  <strong>11</strong> And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,  <strong>12</strong> Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:  <strong>13</strong> And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.  <strong>14</strong> So Solomon built the house, and finished it.  <strong>15</strong> And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.  <strong>16</strong> And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.  <strong>17</strong> And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.  <strong>18</strong> And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.  <strong>19</strong> And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.  <strong>20</strong> And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of  cedar.  <strong>21</strong> So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.  <strong>22</strong> And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.  <strong>23</strong> And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.  <strong>24</strong> And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.  <strong>25</strong> And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.  <strong>26</strong> The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.  <strong>27</strong> And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.  <strong>28</strong> And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.  <strong>29</strong> And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.  <strong>30</strong> And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.  <strong>31</strong> And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.  <strong>32</strong> The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.  <strong>33</strong> So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.  <strong>34</strong> And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were  folding.  <strong>35</strong> And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.  <strong>36</strong> And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.  <strong>37</strong> In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:  <strong>38</strong> And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.  <strong>1</strong> But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.  <strong>2</strong> He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.  <strong>3</strong> And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.  <strong>4</strong> And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.  <strong>5</strong> And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.  <strong>6</strong> And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.  <strong>7</strong> Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even  the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.  <strong>8</strong> And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.  <strong>9</strong> All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.  <strong>10</strong> And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.  <strong>11</strong> And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.  <strong>12</strong> And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.  <strong>13</strong> And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.  <strong>14</strong> He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.  <strong>15</strong> For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.  <strong>16</strong> And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:  <strong>17</strong> And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.  <strong>18</strong> And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.  <strong>19</strong> And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.  <strong>20</strong> And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.  <strong>21</strong> And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz.  <strong>22</strong> And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.  <strong>23</strong> And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.  <strong>24</strong> And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.  <strong>25</strong> It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.  <strong>26</strong> And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.  <strong>27</strong> And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.  <strong>28</strong> And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:  <strong>29</strong> And on the borders that were between the ledges were  lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was  a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.  <strong>30</strong> And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.  <strong>31</strong> And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.  <strong>32</strong> And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half a cubit.  <strong>33</strong> And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were  all molten.  <strong>34</strong> And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.  <strong>35</strong> And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.  <strong>36</strong> For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.  <strong>37</strong> After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.  <strong>38</strong> Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.  <strong>39</strong> And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.  <strong>40</strong> And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:  <strong>41</strong> The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;  <strong>42</strong> And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even  two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;  <strong>43</strong> And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;  <strong>44</strong> And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;  <strong>45</strong> And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of  bright brass.  <strong>46</strong> In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.  <strong>47</strong> And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.  <strong>48</strong> And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,  <strong>49</strong> And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side,  and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,  <strong>50</strong> And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both  for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and  for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.  <strong>51</strong> So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.  <strong>2</strong> And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.  <strong>3</strong> And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.  <strong>4</strong> And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.  <strong>5</strong> And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were  assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.  <strong>6</strong> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even  under the wings of the cherubims.  <strong>7</strong> For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.  <strong>8</strong> And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.  <strong>10</strong> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,  <strong>11</strong> So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.  <strong>12</strong> Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick darkness.  <strong>13</strong> I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.  <strong>14</strong> And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)  <strong>15</strong> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it, saying,  <strong>16</strong> Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.  <strong>17</strong> And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart.  <strong>19</strong> Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.  <strong>20</strong> And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>21</strong> And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.  <strong>22</strong> And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:  <strong>23</strong> And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:  <strong>24</strong> Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.  <strong>26</strong> And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.  <strong>27</strong> But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?  <strong>28</strong> Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:  <strong>29</strong> That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even  toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.  <strong>30</strong> And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.  <strong>31</strong> If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house:  <strong>32</strong> Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.  <strong>33</strong> When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:  <strong>34</strong> Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.  <strong>35</strong> When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:  <strong>36</strong> Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.  <strong>37</strong> If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be;  <strong>38</strong> What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:  <strong>39</strong> Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)  <strong>40</strong> That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.  <strong>41</strong> Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake;  <strong>42</strong> (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;  <strong>43</strong> Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.  <strong>44</strong> If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy name:  <strong>45</strong> Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.  <strong>46</strong> If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;  <strong>47</strong> Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;  <strong>48</strong> And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:  <strong>49</strong> Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,  <strong>50</strong> And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:  <strong>51</strong> For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:  <strong>52</strong> That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.  <strong>53</strong> For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.  <strong>54</strong> And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.  <strong>55</strong> And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,  <strong>56</strong> Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant.  <strong>57</strong> The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us:  <strong>58</strong> That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.  <strong>59</strong> And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:  <strong>60</strong> That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is  God, and that there is none else.  <strong>61</strong> Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.  <strong>62</strong> And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD.  <strong>63</strong> And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.  <strong>64</strong> The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.  <strong>65</strong> And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days.  <strong>66</strong> On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.  <strong>1</strong> And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,  <strong>2</strong> That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.  <strong>3</strong> And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.  <strong>4</strong> And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:  <strong>5</strong> Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:  <strong>7</strong> Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:  <strong>8</strong> And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?  <strong>9</strong> And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.  <strong>10</strong> And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,  <strong>11</strong> (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.  <strong>12</strong> And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.  <strong>13</strong> And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.  <strong>14</strong> And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.  <strong>15</strong> And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.  <strong>16</strong> For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.  <strong>17</strong> And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,  <strong>18</strong> and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,  <strong>19</strong> And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.  <strong>20</strong> And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,  <strong>21</strong> Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.  <strong>22</strong> But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.  <strong>23</strong> These were the chief of the officers that were  over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.  <strong>24</strong> But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.  <strong>25</strong> And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.  <strong>26</strong> And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.  <strong>27</strong> And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.  <strong>28</strong> And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.  <strong>1</strong> And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.  <strong>2</strong> And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.  <strong>3</strong> And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any  thing hid from the king, which he told her not.  <strong>4</strong> And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,  <strong>5</strong> And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.  <strong>6</strong> And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.  <strong>7</strong> Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.  <strong>8</strong> Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.  <strong>9</strong> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.  <strong>10</strong> And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.  <strong>11</strong> And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.  <strong>12</strong> And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.  <strong>13</strong> And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.  <strong>14</strong> Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold.  <strong>15</strong> Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.  <strong>16</strong> And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.  <strong>17</strong> And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.  <strong>18</strong> Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.  <strong>19</strong> The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.  <strong>20</strong> And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.  <strong>21</strong> And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.  <strong>22</strong> For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.  <strong>23</strong> So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.  <strong>24</strong> And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.  <strong>25</strong> And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.  <strong>26</strong> And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.  <strong>27</strong> And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.  <strong>28</strong> And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.  <strong>29</strong> And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels  of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them  out by their means.  <strong>1</strong> But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and  Hittites;  <strong>2</strong> Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.  <strong>3</strong> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.  <strong>4</strong> For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.  <strong>5</strong> For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.  <strong>6</strong> And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did David his father.  <strong>7</strong> Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.  <strong>8</strong> And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,  <strong>10</strong> And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.  <strong>11</strong> Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.  <strong>12</strong> Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.  <strong>13</strong> Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.  <strong>15</strong> For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;  <strong>16</strong> (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:)  <strong>17</strong> That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.  <strong>18</strong> And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.  <strong>19</strong> And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.  <strong>20</strong> And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.  <strong>21</strong> And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.  <strong>22</strong> Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.  <strong>23</strong> And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:  <strong>24</strong> And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.  <strong>25</strong> And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.  <strong>26</strong> And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.  <strong>27</strong> And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.  <strong>28</strong> And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.  <strong>29</strong> And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field:  <strong>30</strong> And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces:  <strong>31</strong> And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:  <strong>32</strong> (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:)  <strong>33</strong> Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.  <strong>34</strong> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:  <strong>35</strong> But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.  <strong>36</strong> And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.  <strong>37</strong> And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.  <strong>38</strong> And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.  <strong>39</strong> And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.  <strong>40</strong> Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.  <strong>41</strong> And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?  <strong>42</strong> And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.  <strong>43</strong> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
