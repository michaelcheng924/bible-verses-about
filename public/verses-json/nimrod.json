power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.  <strong>2</strong> And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.  <strong>3</strong> For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.  <strong>4</strong> And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.  <strong>5</strong> For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.  <strong>6</strong> Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.  <strong>7</strong> How

Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is  the Lord God who judgeth her.  <strong>9</strong> And the kings

scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,  <strong>13</strong> And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.  <strong>14</strong> And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.  <strong>15</strong> The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,  <strong>16</strong> And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!  <strong>17</strong> For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,  <strong>18</strong> And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city!  <strong>19</strong> And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.  <strong>20</strong> Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.  <strong>21</strong> And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.  <strong>22</strong> And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;  <strong>23</strong> And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.  <strong>24</strong> And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.

All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> and cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls! <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off. When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out: \"'Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin! <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said: \"With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's great men. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> In her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints, and of all who have been killed on the earth.\" "},{"_id":"6168cdca3b32607a097c1902","topicId":"6168cdc53b32607a097c18f5","verse":"Jeremiah 50:1-46","votes":33,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p24050001_04-14\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v24050001-1\">50:1&nbsp;</b>The word that the LORD spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet:</p>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v24050002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Declare among the nations and proclaim,</span><br><span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set up a banner and proclaim,</span><br><span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conceal it not, and say:</span><br><span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Babylon is taken,</span><br><span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bel is put to shame,</span><br><span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merodach is dismayed.</span><br><span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Her images are put to shame,</span><br><span id=\"p24050002_04-14\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her idols are dismayed.’</span><br><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</p><p id=\"p24050002_04-14\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v24050003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>“For out of the north a nation has come up against her, which shall make her land a desolation, and none shall dwell in it; both man and beast shall flee away.</p>\n<p id=\"p24050003_04-14\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v24050004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>“In those days and in that time, declares the LORD, the people of Israel and the people of Judah shall come together, weeping as they come, and they shall seek the LORD their God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v24050005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>They shall ask the way to Zion, with faces turned toward it, saying, ‘Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.’</p>\n<p id=\"p24050005_04-14\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v24050006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>“My people have been lost sheep.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is the word the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Announce and proclaim among the nations, lift up a banner and proclaim it; keep nothing back, but say, 'Babylon will be captured; Bel will be put to shame, Marduk filled with terror. Her images will be put to shame and her idols filled with terror.' <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste her land. No one will live in it; both men and animals will flee away. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"In those days, at that time,\" declares the LORD, \"the people of Israel and the people of Judah together will go in tears to seek the LORD their God. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They will come and bind themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray and caused them to roam on the mountains. They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Whoever found them devoured them; their enemies said, 'We are not guilty, for they sinned against the LORD, their true pasture, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Flee out of Babylon; leave the land of the Babylonians, and be like the goats that lead the flock. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the land of the north. They will take up their positions against her, and from the north she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So Babylonia will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Because you rejoice and are glad, you who pillage my inheritance, because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain and neigh like stallions, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who gave you birth will be disgraced. She will be the least of the nations- a wilderness, a dry land, a desert. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Because of the LORD's anger she will not be inhabited but will be completely desolate. All who pass Babylon will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Take up your positions around Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Shout against her on every side! She surrenders, her towers fall, her walls are torn down. Since this is the vengeance of the LORD, take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done to others. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the reaper with his sickle at harvest. Because of the sword of the oppressor let everyone return to his own people, let everyone flee to his own land. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Israel is a scattered flock that lions have chased away. The first to devour him was the king of Assyria; the last to crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But I will bring Israel back to his own pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan; his appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In those days, at that time,\" declares the LORD, \"search will be made for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill and completely destroy them,\" declares the LORD. \"Do everything I have commanded you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The noise of battle is in the land, the noise of great destruction! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! How desolate is Babylon among the nations! <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I set a trap for you, O Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the LORD. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The LORD has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Come against her from afar. Break open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave her no remnant. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come, the time for them to be punished. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the LORD our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for his temple. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Summon archers against Babylon, all those who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"See, I am against you, O arrogant one,\" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty, \"for your day has come, the time for you to be punished. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The arrogant one will stumble and fall and no one will help her up; I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all who are around her.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Yet their Redeemer is strong; the LORD Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land, but unrest to those who live in Babylon. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"A sword against the Babylonians!\" declares the LORD - \"against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men! <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> A sword against her false prophets! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become women. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah along with their neighboring towns,\" declares the LORD, \"so no one will live there; no man will dwell in it. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Look! An army is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They are armed with bows and spears; they are cruel and without mercy. They sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses; they come like men in battle formation to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The king of Babylon has heard reports about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labor. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets to a rich pastureland, I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? Who is like me and who can challenge me? And what shepherd can stand against me?\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon, what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians: The young of the flock will be dragged away; he will completely destroy their pasture because of them. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> At the sound of Babylon's capture the earth will tremble; its cry will resound among the nations.

And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.  <strong>4</strong> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:  <strong>5</strong> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.  <strong>6</strong> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.  <strong>7</strong> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.  <strong>8</strong> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?  <strong>9</strong> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.  <strong>11</strong> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.  <strong>12</strong> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.  <strong>13</strong> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.  <strong>14</strong> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.  <strong>15</strong> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunken neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.  <strong>17</strong> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.  <strong>18</strong> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.  <strong>19</strong> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying,  Because I have asked him of the LORD.  <strong>21</strong> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.  <strong>22</strong> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.  <strong>23</strong> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.  <strong>24</strong> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.  <strong>25</strong> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.  <strong>26</strong> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.  <strong>27</strong> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:  <strong>28</strong> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Elkanah her husband would say to her, \"Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD's temple. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And she made a vow, saying, \"O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> and said to her, \"How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Not so, my lord,\" Hannah replied, \"I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Eli answered, \"Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She said, \"May your servant find favor in your eyes.\" Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, \"Because I asked the LORD for him.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, \"After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Do what seems best to you,\" Elkanah her husband told her. \"Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word.\" So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and she said to him, \"As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD.\" And he worshiped the LORD there.
