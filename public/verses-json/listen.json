(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)  <strong>7</strong> Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)  <strong>8</strong> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;  <strong>9</strong> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  <strong>10</strong> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  <strong>11</strong> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  <strong>12</strong> For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  <strong>13</strong> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>14</strong> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  <strong>15</strong> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  <strong>16</strong> But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  <strong>17</strong> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  <strong>18</strong> But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.  <strong>19</strong> But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.  <strong>20</strong> But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.  <strong>21</strong> But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: \"The man who does these things will live by them.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the righteousness that is by faith says: \"Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'\" (that is, to bring Christ down) <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"or 'Who will descend into the deep?'\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But what does it say? \"The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,\" that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> That if you confess with your mouth, \"Jesus is Lord,\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As the Scripture says, \"Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> for, \"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, \"How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, \"Lord, who has believed our message?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: \"Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, \"I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And Isaiah boldly says, \"I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> But concerning Israel he says, \"All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people.\" "},{"_id":"616772566451fe5325fa0d5d","topicId":"616772506451fe5325fa0d49","verse":"John 10:16","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43010016_01-20\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43010016-1\">16&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold.
