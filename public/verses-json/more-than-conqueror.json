And he divided unto them his living.  <strong>13</strong> And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.  <strong>14</strong> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.  <strong>15</strong> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.  <strong>16</strong> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.  <strong>17</strong> And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!  <strong>18</strong> I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,  <strong>19</strong> And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.  <strong>20</strong> And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.  <strong>21</strong> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.  <strong>22</strong> But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:  <strong>23</strong> And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:  <strong>24</strong> For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.

So he divided his property between them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So he got up and went to his father. \"But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son. ' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Bring the fattened calf and kill it.
