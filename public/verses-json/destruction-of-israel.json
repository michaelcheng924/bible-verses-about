Amen.  <strong>6</strong> Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:  <strong>7</strong> Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.  <strong>8</strong> That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are  not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.  <strong>9</strong> For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.  <strong>10</strong> And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;  <strong>11</strong> (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)  <strong>12</strong> It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.  <strong>13</strong> As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.  <strong>14</strong> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.  <strong>15</strong> For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.  <strong>16</strong> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.  <strong>17</strong> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.  <strong>18</strong> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?  <strong>20</strong> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?  <strong>21</strong> Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?  <strong>22</strong> What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:  <strong>23</strong> And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,  <strong>24</strong> Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?  <strong>25</strong> As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.  <strong>26</strong> And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.  <strong>27</strong> Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:  <strong>28</strong> For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.  <strong>30</strong> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.  <strong>31</strong> But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;  <strong>33</strong> As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  <strong>1</strong> Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.  <strong>2</strong> For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.  <strong>3</strong> For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.  <strong>4</strong> For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.  <strong>5</strong> For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.  <strong>6</strong> But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)  <strong>7</strong> Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)  <strong>8</strong> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;  <strong>9</strong> That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  <strong>10</strong> For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  <strong>11</strong> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  <strong>12</strong> For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  <strong>13</strong> For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>14</strong> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?  <strong>15</strong> And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!  <strong>16</strong> But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?  <strong>17</strong> So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  <strong>18</strong> But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.  <strong>19</strong> But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.  <strong>20</strong> But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.  <strong>21</strong> But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.  <strong>1</strong> I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.  <strong>2</strong> God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,  <strong>3</strong> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.  <strong>4</strong> But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of  Baal.  <strong>5</strong> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.  <strong>6</strong> And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.  <strong>7</strong> What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded  <strong>8</strong> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.  <strong>9</strong> And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:  <strong>10</strong> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.  <strong>11</strong> I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.  <strong>12</strong> Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?  <strong>13</strong> For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:  <strong>14</strong> If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them.  <strong>15</strong> For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?  <strong>16</strong> For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.  <strong>17</strong> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;  <strong>18</strong> Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.  <strong>19</strong> Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.  <strong>20</strong> Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:  <strong>21</strong> For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.  <strong>22</strong> Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.  <strong>23</strong> And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.  <strong>24</strong> For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?  <strong>25</strong> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.  <strong>26</strong> And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:  <strong>27</strong> For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.  <strong>28</strong> As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.  <strong>29</strong> For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.  <strong>30</strong> For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:  <strong>31</strong> Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.  <strong>32</strong> For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  <strong>33</strong> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!  <strong>34</strong> For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?  <strong>35</strong> Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?  <strong>36</strong> For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

Again you will take up your tambourines and go out to dance with the joyful. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim, 'Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.'\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, 'O LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> See, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Hear the word of the LORD, O nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: 'He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For the LORD will ransom Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the LORD - the grain, the new wine and the oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then maidens will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded,\" declares the LORD. \"They will return from the land of the enemy. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So there is hope for your future,\" declares the LORD. \"Your children will return to their own land. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning: 'You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been disciplined. Restore me, and I will return, because you are the LORD my God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Set up road signs; put up guideposts.

The LORD will create a new thing on earth- a woman will surround a man.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"When I bring them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: 'The LORD bless you, O righteous dwelling, O sacred mountain.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> People will live together in Judah and all its towns-farmers and those who move about with their flocks. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At this I awoke and looked around.

They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.  <strong>17</strong> And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.  <strong>18</strong> For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.  <strong>19</strong> Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.  <strong>20</strong> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.  <strong>21</strong> Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.  <strong>22</strong> But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.  <strong>23</strong> But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  <strong>24</strong> Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.  <strong>25</strong> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.  <strong>26</strong> For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  <strong>27</strong> For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  <strong>28</strong> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  <strong>29</strong> And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what you heard? <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Have you suffered so much for nothing--if it really was for nothing? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you because you observe the law, or because you believe what you heard? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Consider Abraham: \"He believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: \"All nations will be blessed through you.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written: \"Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, \"The righteous will live by faith.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, \"The man who does these things will live by them.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: \"Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say \"and to seeds,\" meaning many people, but \"and to your seed,\" meaning one person, who is Christ. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
