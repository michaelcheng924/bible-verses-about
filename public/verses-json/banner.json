","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is the word the LORD spoke through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Announce and proclaim among the nations, lift up a banner and proclaim it; keep nothing back, but say, 'Babylon will be captured; Bel will be put to shame, Marduk filled with terror. Her images will be put to shame and her idols filled with terror.' <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> A nation from the north will attack her and lay waste her land. No one will live in it; both men and animals will flee away. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"In those days, at that time,\" declares the LORD, \"the people of Israel and the people of Judah together will go in tears to seek the LORD their God. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces toward it. They will come and bind themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have led them astray and caused them to roam on the mountains. They wandered over mountain and hill and forgot their own resting place. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Whoever found them devoured them; their enemies said, 'We are not guilty, for they sinned against the LORD, their true pasture, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"Flee out of Babylon; leave the land of the Babylonians, and be like the goats that lead the flock. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For I will stir up and bring against Babylon an alliance of great nations from the land of the north. They will take up their positions against her, and from the north she will be captured. Their arrows will be like skilled warriors who do not return empty-handed. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So Babylonia will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Because you rejoice and are glad, you who pillage my inheritance, because you frolic like a heifer threshing grain and neigh like stallions, <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who gave you birth will be disgraced. She will be the least of the nations- a wilderness, a dry land, a desert. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Because of the LORD's anger she will not be inhabited but will be completely desolate. All who pass Babylon will be horrified and scoff because of all her wounds. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Take up your positions around Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her! Spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Shout against her on every side! She surrenders, her towers fall, her walls are torn down. Since this is the vengeance of the LORD, take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done to others. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Cut off from Babylon the sower, and the reaper with his sickle at harvest. Because of the sword of the oppressor let everyone return to his own people, let everyone flee to his own land. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Israel is a scattered flock that lions have chased away. The first to devour him was the king of Assyria; the last to crush his bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But I will bring Israel back to his own pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan; his appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In those days, at that time,\" declares the LORD, \"search will be made for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Attack the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, kill and completely destroy them,\" declares the LORD. \"Do everything I have commanded you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The noise of battle is in the land, the noise of great destruction! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> How broken and shattered is the hammer of the whole earth! How desolate is Babylon among the nations! <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> I set a trap for you, O Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the LORD. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The LORD has opened his arsenal and brought out the weapons of his wrath, for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do in the land of the Babylonians. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Come against her from afar. Break open her granaries; pile her up like heaps of grain. Completely destroy her and leave her no remnant. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Kill all her young bulls; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them! For their day has come, the time for them to be punished. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon declaring in Zion how the LORD our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for his temple. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Summon archers against Babylon, all those who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her for her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"See, I am against you, O arrogant one,\" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty, \"for your day has come, the time for you to be punished. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The arrogant one will stumble and fall and no one will help her up; I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all who are around her.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty says: \"The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Yet their Redeemer is strong; the LORD Almighty is his name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that he may bring rest to their land, but unrest to those who live in Babylon. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"A sword against the Babylonians!\" declares the LORD - \"against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men! <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> A sword against her false prophets! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become women. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, idols that will go mad with terror. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"So desert creatures and hyenas will live there, and there the owl will dwell.

 <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.

And the evening and the morning were the second day.  <strong>9</strong> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  <strong>10</strong> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>11</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>12</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>13</strong> And the evening and the morning were the third day.  <strong>14</strong> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  <strong>15</strong> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>16</strong> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  <strong>17</strong> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  <strong>18</strong> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>19</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  <strong>20</strong> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  <strong>21</strong> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>22</strong> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  <strong>23</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  <strong>24</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  <strong>25</strong> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>26</strong> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  <strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  <strong>28</strong> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  <strong>30</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  <strong>31</strong> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was  very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God called the expanse \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day. "}]}
