In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God. ","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is  good for a man not to touch a woman.  <strong>2</strong> Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.  <strong>3</strong> Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.  <strong>4</strong> The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.  <strong>5</strong> Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.  <strong>6</strong> But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.  <strong>7</strong> For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
