Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings courts.  <strong>26</strong> But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.  <strong>27</strong> This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  <strong>28</strong> For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.  <strong>29</strong> And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.  <strong>30</strong> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.  <strong>31</strong> And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?  <strong>32</strong> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.  <strong>33</strong> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.  <strong>34</strong> The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!  <strong>35</strong> But wisdom is justified of all her children. <strong>36</strong>           And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.  <strong>37</strong> And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,  <strong>38</strong> And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.  <strong>39</strong> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.  <strong>40</strong> And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.  <strong>41</strong> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.  <strong>42</strong> And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?  <strong>43</strong> Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.  <strong>44</strong> And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.  <strong>45</strong> Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.  <strong>46</strong> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.  <strong>47</strong> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.  <strong>49</strong> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?  <strong>50</strong> And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, \"This man deserves to have you do this, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: \"Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, \"I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, \"Don't cry.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, \"Young man, I say to you, get up!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> They were all filled with awe and praised God. \"A great prophet has appeared among us,\" they said. \"God has come to help his people.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> he sent them to the Lord to ask, \"Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When the men came to Jesus, they said, \"John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> So he replied to the messengers, \"Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: \"What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> This is the one about whom it is written: \"'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: \"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and \"sinners.\"' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But wisdom is proved right by all her children.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, \"If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Jesus answered him, \"Simon, I have something to tell you.Tell me, teacher,\" he said. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Simon replied, \"I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.You have judged correctly,\" Jesus said. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, \"Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to her, \"Your sins are forgiven.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The other guests began to say among themselves, \"Who is this who even forgives sins?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said to the woman, \"Your faith has saved you; go in peace.\" "},{"_id":"61678b21a3a86b670bc2f652","topicId":"61678b1fa3a86b670bc2f649","verse":"Isaiah 55:1","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p23055001_06-9\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v23055001-1\">55:1&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come, everyone who thirsts,</span><br><span id=\"p23055001_06-9\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come to the waters;</span><br><span id=\"p23055001_06-9\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who has no money,</span><br><span id=\"p23055001_06-9\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, buy and eat!</span><br><span id=\"p23055001_06-9\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, buy wine and milk</span><br><span id=\"p23055001_06-9\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without money and without price.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>1</strong> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
