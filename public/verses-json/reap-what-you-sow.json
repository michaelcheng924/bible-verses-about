a man of knowledge increaseth strength.  <strong>6</strong> For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.  <strong>7</strong> Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the gate.  <strong>8</strong> He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.  <strong>9</strong> The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is  an abomination to men.  <strong>10</strong> If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.  <strong>11</strong> If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and those that are ready to be slain;  <strong>12</strong> If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not  he know it? and shall not he render to every  man according to his works?  <strong>13</strong> My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:  <strong>14</strong> So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.  <strong>15</strong> Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:  <strong>16</strong> For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.  <strong>17</strong> Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:  <strong>18</strong> Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.  <strong>19</strong> Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked;  <strong>20</strong> For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.  <strong>21</strong> My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:  <strong>22</strong> For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?  <strong>23</strong> These things also belong to the wise. It is  not good to have respect of persons in judgment.  <strong>24</strong> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:  <strong>25</strong> But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.  <strong>26</strong> Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.  <strong>27</strong> Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house.  <strong>28</strong> Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips.  <strong>29</strong> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.  <strong>30</strong> I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;  <strong>31</strong> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.  <strong>32</strong> Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.  <strong>33</strong> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:  <strong>34</strong> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man.

Will he not repay each person according to what he has done? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Know also that wisdom is sweet to your soul; if you find it, there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against a righteous man's house, do not raid his dwelling place; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again, but the wicked are brought down by calamity. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when he stumbles, do not let your heart rejoice, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Fear the LORD and the king, my son, and do not join with the rebellious, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> for those two will send sudden destruction upon them, and who knows what calamities they can bring? Further Sayings of the Wise <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> These also are sayings of the wise: To show partiality in judging is not good: <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Whoever says to the guilty, \"You are innocent\"- peoples will curse him and nations denounce him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not say, \"I'll do to him as he has done to me; I'll pay that man back for what he did.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> I went past the field of the sluggard, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw: <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.

How then can anyone understand his own way? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider his vows. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> A wise king winnows out the wicked; he drives the threshing wheel over them. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The lamp of the LORD searches the spirit of a man; it searches out his inmost being. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Love and faithfulness keep a king safe; through love his throne is made secure. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The glory of young men is their strength, gray hair the splendor of the old. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Blows and wounds cleanse away evil, and beatings purge the inmost being.

For if you do these things, you will never fall, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, \"This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
