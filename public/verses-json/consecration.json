Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.
