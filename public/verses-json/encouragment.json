Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
