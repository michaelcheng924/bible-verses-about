 <strong>10</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  <strong>11</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.  <strong>12</strong> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  <strong>13</strong> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. <strong>14</strong>           And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:  <strong>15</strong> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <strong>16</strong>           For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  <strong>17</strong> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. <strong>18</strong>           He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  <strong>19</strong> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  <strong>20</strong> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  <strong>21</strong> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. <strong>22</strong> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.  <strong>23</strong> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.  <strong>24</strong> For John was not yet cast into prison.  <strong>25</strong> Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.  <strong>26</strong> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.  <strong>27</strong> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.  <strong>29</strong> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.  <strong>30</strong> He must increase, but I must decrease.  <strong>31</strong> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.  <strong>32</strong> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.  <strong>33</strong> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.  <strong>34</strong> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.  <strong>35</strong> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.  <strong>36</strong> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, \"Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God.

The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" ","modified":"2023-09-10T01:52:20.617Z"},{"_id":"61607058eb63b282e3fc380c","topicId":"61607057eb63b282e3fc3808","verse":"John 20:31","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43020001_03-5\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v43020001-1\">20:1&nbsp;</b>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43020002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43020003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43020004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43020005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43020006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb.

 <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> David said about him: \"'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

And he went in to tarry with them.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.  <strong>31</strong> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.  <strong>32</strong> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?  <strong>33</strong> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,  <strong>34</strong> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.  <strong>35</strong> And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.  <strong>36</strong> And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.  <strong>37</strong> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?  <strong>39</strong> Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.  <strong>40</strong> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.  <strong>41</strong> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?  <strong>42</strong> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.  <strong>43</strong> And he took it, and did eat before them.  <strong>44</strong> And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.  <strong>45</strong> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,  <strong>46</strong> And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:  <strong>47</strong> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.  <strong>48</strong> And ye are witnesses of these things. <strong>49</strong>           And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.  <strong>50</strong> And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.  <strong>51</strong> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.  <strong>52</strong> And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:  <strong>53</strong> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, \"Why do you look for the living among the dead? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then they remembered his words. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but they were kept from recognizing him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He asked them, \"What are you discussing together as you walk along?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They stood still, their faces downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, \"Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"What things?\" he asked. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"About Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. \"He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He said to them, \"How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But they urged him strongly, \"Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.\" So he went in to stay with them. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They asked each other, \"Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and saying, \"It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, \"Peace be with you.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> He said to them, \"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, \"Do you have anything here to eat?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and he took it and ate it in their presence. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> He said to them, \"This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> He told them, \"This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> You are witnesses of these things. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.

And they launched forth.  <strong>23</strong> But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.  <strong>24</strong> And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.  <strong>25</strong> And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.  <strong>26</strong> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.  <strong>27</strong> And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.  <strong>28</strong> When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.  <strong>29</strong> (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.  <strong>31</strong> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.  <strong>32</strong> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.  <strong>33</strong> Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.  <strong>34</strong> When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.  <strong>35</strong> Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  <strong>36</strong> They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.  <strong>37</strong> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.  <strong>38</strong> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,  <strong>39</strong> Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.  <strong>40</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.  <strong>41</strong> And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:  <strong>42</strong> For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.  <strong>43</strong> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,  <strong>44</strong> Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.  <strong>45</strong> And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  <strong>46</strong> And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.  <strong>47</strong> And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.  <strong>48</strong> And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. <strong>49</strong> While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.  <strong>50</strong> But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.  <strong>51</strong> And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.  <strong>52</strong> And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.  <strong>53</strong> And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.  <strong>54</strong> And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.  <strong>55</strong> And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.  <strong>56</strong> And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.\" When he said this, he called out, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> His disciples asked him what this parable meant. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He said, \"The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, \"'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Someone told him, \"Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He replied, \"My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> One day Jesus said to his disciples, \"Let's go over to the other side of the lake.\" So they got into a boat and set out. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples went and woke him, saying, \"Master, Master, we're going to drown!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. \"Where is your faith?\" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, \"Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Legion,\" he replied, because many demons had gone into him. And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Return home and tell how much God has done for you.\" So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who touched me?\" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, \"Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> But Jesus said, \"Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Then he said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" he said. \"Don't bother the teacher any more.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, \"Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. \"Stop wailing,\" Jesus said. \"She is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> But he took her by the hand and said, \"My child, get up!\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
