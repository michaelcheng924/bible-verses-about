sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.  <strong>16</strong> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.  <strong>17</strong> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.  <strong>18</strong> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.  <strong>19</strong> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.  <strong>20</strong> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.  <strong>21</strong> And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.  <strong>22</strong> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  <strong>23</strong> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.  <strong>24</strong> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The days are coming,' declares the LORD, 'when I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from captivity and restore them to the land I gave their forefathers to possess,' says the LORD.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> These are the words the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD says: \"'Cries of fear are heard- terror, not peace. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Ask and see: Can a man bear children? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor, every face turned deathly pale? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> How awful that day will be! None will be like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be saved out of it. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"'In that day,' declares the LORD Almighty, 'I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Instead, they will serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"'So do not fear, O Jacob my servant; do not be dismayed, O Israel,' declares the LORD. 'I will surely save you out of a distant place, your descendants from the land of their exile. Jacob will again have peace and security, and no one will make him afraid. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I am with you and will save you,' declares the LORD. 'Though I completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you, I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you but only with justice; I will not let you go entirely unpunished.' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD says: \"'Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> There is no one to plead your cause, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> All your allies have forgotten you; they care nothing for you. I have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel, because your guilt is so great and your sins so many. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because of your great guilt and many sins I have done these things to you. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"'But all who devour you will be devoured; all your enemies will go into exile. Those who plunder you will be plundered; all who make spoil of you I will despoil. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But I will restore you to health and heal your wounds,' declares the LORD, 'because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"This is what the LORD says: \"'I will restore the fortunes of Jacob's tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on her ruins, and the palace will stand in its proper place. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will add to their numbers, and they will not be decreased; I will bring them honor, and they will not be disdained. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Their children will be as in days of old, and their community will be established before me; I will punish all who oppress them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Their leader will be one of their own; their ruler will arise from among them. I will bring him near and he will come close to me, for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?' declares the LORD. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"'So you will be my people, and I will be your God.'\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> See, the storm of the LORD will burst out in wrath, a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart. In days to come you will understand this.
