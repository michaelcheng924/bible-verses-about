ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.  <strong>3</strong> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>4</strong> LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.  <strong>5</strong> The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel.  <strong>6</strong> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways.  <strong>7</strong> The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.  <strong>8</strong> They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  <strong>9</strong> My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.  <strong>11</strong> They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants  of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.  <strong>12</strong> Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.  <strong>13</strong> Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.  <strong>14</strong> Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.  <strong>15</strong> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.  <strong>16</strong> Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart.  <strong>17</strong> Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.  <strong>18</strong> Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.  <strong>19</strong> The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.  <strong>20</strong> They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera.  <strong>21</strong> The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.  <strong>22</strong> Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.  <strong>23</strong> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.  <strong>24</strong> Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.  <strong>25</strong> He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish.  <strong>26</strong> She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.  <strong>27</strong> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.  <strong>28</strong> The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?  <strong>29</strong> Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself,  <strong>30</strong> Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?  <strong>31</strong> So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves- praise the LORD! <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I will sing to the LORD, I will sing; I will make music to the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"O LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the roads were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Village life in Israel ceased, ceased until I, Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they chose new gods, war came to the city gates, and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the LORD! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> the voice of the singers at the watering places. They recite the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous acts of his warriors in Israel. \"Then the people of the LORD went down to the city gates. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> 'Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, O Barak! Take captive your captives, O son of Abinoam.' <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Then the men who were left came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came to me with the mighty. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's staff. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, rushing after him into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Why did you stay among the campfires to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the heights of the field. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Kings came, they fought; the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no silver, no plunder. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then thundered the horses' hoofs- galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> 'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD. 'Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell-dead. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> 'Are they not finding and dividing the spoils: a girl or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck- all this as plunder?' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength.\" Then the land had peace forty years.
