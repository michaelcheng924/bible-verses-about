But for Adam no suitable helper was found. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The man said, \"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman, 'for she was taken out of man.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.

let not the arrogant oppress me. <sup><strong>123</strong></sup> My eyes fail, looking for your salvation, looking for your righteous promise. <sup><strong>124</strong></sup> Deal with your servant according to your love and teach me your decrees. <sup><strong>125</strong></sup> I am your servant; give me discernment that I may understand your statutes. <sup><strong>126</strong></sup> It is time for you to act, O LORD; your law is being broken. <sup><strong>127</strong></sup> Because I love your commands more than gold, more than pure gold, <sup><strong>128</strong></sup> and because I consider all your precepts right, I hate every wrong path. <sup><strong>129</strong></sup> Your statutes are wonderful;

let no sin rule over me. <sup><strong>134</strong></sup> Redeem me from the oppression of men, that I may obey your precepts. <sup><strong>135</strong></sup> Make your face shine upon your servant and teach me your decrees. <sup><strong>136</strong></sup> Streams of tears flow from my eyes, for your law is not obeyed. <sup><strong>137</strong></sup> Righteous are you, O LORD, and your laws are right. <sup><strong>138</strong></sup> The statutes you have laid down are righteous; they are fully trustworthy. <sup><strong>139</strong></sup> My zeal wears me out, for my enemies ignore your words. <sup><strong>140</strong></sup> Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your servant loves them. <sup><strong>141</strong></sup> Though I am lowly and despised, I do not forget your precepts. <sup><strong>142</strong></sup> Your righteousness is everlasting and your law is true. <sup><strong>143</strong></sup> Trouble and distress have come upon me, but your commands are my delight. <sup><strong>144</strong></sup> Your statutes are forever right;

preserve my life, O LORD, according to your laws. <sup><strong>150</strong></sup> Those who devise wicked schemes are near, but they are far from your law. <sup><strong>151</strong></sup> Yet you are near, O LORD, and all your commands are true. <sup><strong>152</strong></sup> Long ago I learned from your statutes that you established them to last forever. <sup><strong>153</strong></sup> Look upon my suffering and deliver me, for I have not forgotten your law. <sup><strong>154</strong></sup> Defend my cause and redeem me; preserve my life according to your promise. <sup><strong>155</strong></sup> Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek out your decrees. <sup><strong>156</strong></sup> Your compassion is great, O LORD; preserve my life according to your laws. <sup><strong>157</strong></sup> Many are the foes who persecute me, but I have not turned from your statutes. <sup><strong>158</strong></sup> I look on the faithless with loathing, for they do not obey your word. <sup><strong>159</strong></sup> See how I love your precepts; preserve my life, O LORD, according to your love. <sup><strong>160</strong></sup> All your words are true; all your righteous laws are eternal. <sup><strong>161</strong></sup> Rulers persecute me without cause, but my heart trembles at your word. <sup><strong>162</strong></sup> I rejoice in your promise like one who finds great spoil. <sup><strong>163</strong></sup> I hate and abhor falsehood but I love your law. <sup><strong>164</strong></sup> Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous laws. <sup><strong>165</strong></sup> Great peace have they who love your law, and nothing can make them stumble. <sup><strong>166</strong></sup> I wait for your salvation, O LORD, and I follow your commands. <sup><strong>167</strong></sup> I obey your statutes, for I love them greatly. <sup><strong>168</strong></sup> I obey your precepts and your statutes, for all my ways are known to you. <sup><strong>169</strong></sup> May my cry come before you, O LORD; give me understanding according to your word. <sup><strong>170</strong></sup> May my supplication come before you; deliver me according to your promise. <sup><strong>171</strong></sup> May my lips overflow with praise, for you teach me your decrees. <sup><strong>172</strong></sup> May my tongue sing of your word, for all your commands are righteous. <sup><strong>173</strong></sup> May your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts. <sup><strong>174</strong></sup> I long for your salvation, O LORD, and your law is my delight. <sup><strong>175</strong></sup> Let me live that I may praise you, and may your laws sustain me. <sup><strong>176</strong></sup> I have strayed like a lost sheep.

And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.  <strong>5</strong> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?  <strong>6</strong> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their  lips, but their heart is far from me.  <strong>7</strong> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  <strong>8</strong> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.  <strong>10</strong> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:  <strong>11</strong> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is  Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.  <strong>12</strong> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;  <strong>13</strong> Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. <strong>14</strong> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:  <strong>15</strong> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.  <strong>16</strong> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>17</strong> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.  <strong>18</strong> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;  <strong>19</strong> Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?  <strong>20</strong> And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.  <strong>21</strong> For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,  <strong>22</strong> Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:  <strong>23</strong> All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.  <strong>24</strong> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it:  but he could not be hid.  <strong>25</strong> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:  <strong>26</strong> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.  <strong>27</strong> But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.  <strong>28</strong> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.  <strong>29</strong> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.  <strong>30</strong> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.  <strong>31</strong> And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.  <strong>32</strong> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;  <strong>34</strong> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha,  that is, Be opened.  <strong>35</strong> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.  <strong>36</strong> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;  <strong>37</strong> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were \"unclean,\" that is, unwashed. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles. ) <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, \"Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He replied, \"Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \"'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And he said to them: \"You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother: 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God), <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, \"Listen to me, everyone, and understand this. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Are you so dull?\" he asked. \"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \"clean.\") <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He went on: \"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ). <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> People were overwhelmed with amazement. \"He has done everything well,\" they said. \"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\" "},{"_id":"616d8bd075868033c7105352","topicId":"616d8bca75868033c7105342","verse":"Acts 3:21","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p44003021_01-17\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v44003021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>21</strong> Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.
