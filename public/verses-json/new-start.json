if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?

 <strong>34</strong> And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.  <strong>35</strong> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
