have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.  <strong>2</strong> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.  <strong>3</strong> For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.  <strong>4</strong> Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.  <strong>5</strong> Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;  <strong>6</strong> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;  <strong>7</strong> Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.  <strong>8</strong> Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.  <strong>9</strong> Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.  <strong>10</strong> Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.  <strong>11</strong> I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is  no saviour.  <strong>12</strong> I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was  no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I am God.  <strong>13</strong> Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is  none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?  <strong>14</strong> Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.  <strong>15</strong> I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.  <strong>16</strong> Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;  <strong>17</strong> Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.  <strong>18</strong> Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.  <strong>19</strong> Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.  <strong>20</strong> The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.  <strong>21</strong> This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.  <strong>22</strong> But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.  <strong>23</strong> Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.  <strong>24</strong> Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.  <strong>25</strong> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.  <strong>26</strong> Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.  <strong>27</strong> Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.  <strong>28</strong> Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For I am the LORD, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your stead. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you, and people in exchange for your life. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.'

Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, O Israel. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices.
