The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, \"The two will become one flesh.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.
