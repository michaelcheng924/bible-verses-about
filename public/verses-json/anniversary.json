Everything is meaningless.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Is there anything of which one can say, \"Look! This is something new\"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men! <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I thought to myself, \"Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.
