","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the Baals <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> His heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> With them were certain Levites-Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah-and the priests Elishama and Jehoram. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks: seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Their enrollment by families was as follows: From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men; <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> next, Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered himself for the service of the LORD, with 200,000. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> From Benjamin: Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields; <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
