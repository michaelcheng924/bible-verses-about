But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

If God be for us, who can be against us?  <strong>32</strong> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  <strong>33</strong> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is  God that justifieth.  <strong>34</strong> Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  <strong>35</strong> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  <strong>36</strong> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  <strong>37</strong> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  <strong>38</strong> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  <strong>39</strong> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
