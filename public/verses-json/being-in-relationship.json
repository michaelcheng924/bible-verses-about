for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.  <strong>14</strong> And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.  <strong>15</strong> And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.  <strong>16</strong> There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.  <strong>17</strong> And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.  <strong>18</strong> And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.  <strong>19</strong> And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.  <strong>20</strong> And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:  <strong>21</strong> And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.  <strong>22</strong> What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.  <strong>23</strong> Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;  <strong>24</strong> Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.  <strong>25</strong> As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and  concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.  <strong>26</strong> Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.  <strong>27</strong> And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,  <strong>28</strong> Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.  <strong>29</strong> (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)  <strong>30</strong> And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.  <strong>31</strong> And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.  <strong>32</strong> Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.  <strong>33</strong> Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.  <strong>34</strong> And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.  <strong>35</strong> And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.  <strong>36</strong> For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.  <strong>37</strong> And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?  <strong>38</strong> Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?  <strong>39</strong> But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.  <strong>40</strong> And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people.

We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Finding the disciples there, we stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But when our time was up, we left and continued on our way. All the disciples and their wives and children accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After saying good-by to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, \"The Holy Spirit says, 'In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Paul answered, \"Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, \"The Lord's will be done.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> After this, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers received us warmly. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: \"You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> What shall we do?

Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> shouting, \"Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> (They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple area.) <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> The crowd that followed kept shouting, \"Away with him!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, \"May I say something to you?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"Do you speak Greek?\" he replied. \"Aren't you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the desert some time ago?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Paul answered, \"I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city.

Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was  in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.  <strong>10</strong> And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.  <strong>11</strong> So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:  <strong>12</strong> And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s son,  and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.  <strong>13</strong> And I charged Baruch before them, saying,  <strong>14</strong> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.  <strong>15</strong> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.  <strong>16</strong> Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,  <strong>17</strong> Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee:  <strong>18</strong> Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, is his name,  <strong>19</strong> Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes are  open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:  <strong>20</strong> Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even  unto this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day;  <strong>21</strong> And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;  <strong>22</strong> And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;  <strong>23</strong> And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:  <strong>24</strong> Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.  <strong>25</strong> And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.  <strong>26</strong> Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,  <strong>27</strong> Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?

But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.  <strong>28</strong> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  <strong>29</strong> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  <strong>30</strong> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  <strong>31</strong> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.  <strong>32</strong> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  <strong>33</strong> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.  <strong>34</strong> Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.  <strong>35</strong> But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?  <strong>36</strong> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:  <strong>37</strong> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:  <strong>38</strong> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.  <strong>39</strong> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.  <strong>40</strong> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  <strong>41</strong> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.  <strong>42</strong> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  <strong>43</strong> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:  <strong>44</strong> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  <strong>45</strong> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  <strong>46</strong> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  <strong>47</strong> The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.  <strong>48</strong> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  <strong>49</strong> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  <strong>50</strong> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  <strong>52</strong> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  <strong>53</strong> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  <strong>54</strong> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  <strong>55</strong> O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is  thy victory?  <strong>56</strong> The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is  the law.  <strong>57</strong> But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong>58</strong> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The last enemy to be destroyed is death. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For he \"has put everything under his feet.\" Now when it says that \"everything\" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I die every day--I mean that, brothers--just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, \"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Do not be misled: \"Bad company corrupts good character.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But someone may ask, \"How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> So it is written: \"The first man Adam became a living being\"; the last Adam, a lifegiving spirit. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed-- <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: \"Death has been swallowed up in victory.\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> \"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.

But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.  <strong>8</strong> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.  <strong>9</strong> But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.  <strong>10</strong> And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:  <strong>11</strong> But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.  <strong>12</strong> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  <strong>13</strong> And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  <strong>14</strong> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  <strong>15</strong> But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.  <strong>16</strong> For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy  husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy  wife?  <strong>17</strong> But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.  <strong>18</strong> Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.  <strong>19</strong> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.  <strong>20</strong> Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.  <strong>21</strong> Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.  <strong>22</strong> For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.  <strong>23</strong> Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.  <strong>24</strong> Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.  <strong>25</strong> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.  <strong>26</strong> I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.  <strong>27</strong> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  <strong>28</strong> But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.  <strong>29</strong> But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;  <strong>30</strong> And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;  <strong>31</strong> And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.  <strong>32</strong> But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:  <strong>33</strong> But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.  <strong>34</strong> There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.  <strong>35</strong> And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.  <strong>36</strong> But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.  <strong>37</strong> Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.  <strong>38</strong> So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.  <strong>39</strong> The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.  <strong>40</strong> But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now for the matters you wrote about: It is good for a man not to marry. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I say this as a concession, not as a command. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none; <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep; <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife-- <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.

They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" The man took Jesus at his word and departed. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and all his household believed. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.
