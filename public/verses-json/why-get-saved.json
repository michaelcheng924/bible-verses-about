So Moses was angry with them. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much-two omers for each person-and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> He said to them, \"This is what the LORD commanded: 'Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Eat it today,\" Moses said, \"because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Moses, \"How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions? <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So the people rested on the seventh day. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The people of Israel called the bread manna.
