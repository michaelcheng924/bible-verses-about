And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  <strong>15</strong> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  <strong>16</strong> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  <strong>17</strong> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;  <strong>18</strong> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;  <strong>19</strong> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  <strong>20</strong> And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.  <strong>21</strong> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  <strong>22</strong> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  <strong>23</strong> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  <strong>24</strong> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The man said, \"The woman you put here with me-she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then the LORD God said to the woman, \"What is this you have done?\" The woman said, \"The serpent deceived me, and I ate.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So the LORD God said to the serpent, \"Because you have done this, \"Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> To the woman he said, \"I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> To Adam he said, \"Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,'\"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
