So they came and stood before the king.  <strong>3</strong> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.  <strong>4</strong> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.  <strong>5</strong> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.  <strong>6</strong> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.  <strong>7</strong> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.  <strong>8</strong> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.  <strong>9</strong> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but  one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.  <strong>10</strong> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is  no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.  <strong>11</strong> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.  <strong>12</strong> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.  <strong>13</strong> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.  <strong>14</strong> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:  <strong>15</strong> He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is  the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.  <strong>16</strong> Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.  <strong>17</strong> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:  <strong>18</strong> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.  <strong>19</strong> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:  <strong>21</strong> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:  <strong>22</strong> He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is  in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.  <strong>23</strong> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.  <strong>25</strong> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.  <strong>26</strong> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?  <strong>27</strong> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;  <strong>28</strong> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;  <strong>29</strong> As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.  <strong>30</strong> But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any  wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.  <strong>31</strong> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image.

So tell me the dream and interpret it for me.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Once more they replied, \"Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the king answered, \"I am certain that you are trying to gain time, because you realize that this is what I have firmly decided: <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> If you do not tell me the dream, there is just one penalty for you.

No king, however great and mighty, has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among men.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Arioch, the commander of the king's guard, had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon, Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He asked the king's officer, \"Why did the king issue such a harsh decree?\" Arioch then explained the matter to Daniel. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At this, Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He urged them to plead for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> During the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and said: \"Praise be to the name of God for ever and ever; wisdom and power are his. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He changes times and seasons; he sets up kings and deposes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> He reveals deep and hidden things; he knows what lies in darkness, and light dwells with him. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> I thank and praise you, O God of my fathers: You have given me wisdom and power, you have made known to me what we asked of you, you have made known to us the dream of the king.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said to him, \"Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Arioch took Daniel to the king at once and said, \"I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king asked Daniel (also called Belteshazzar), \"Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Daniel replied, \"No wise man, enchanter, magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"As you were lying there, O king, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me, not because I have greater wisdom than other living men, but so that you, O king, may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You looked, O king, and there before you stood a large statue-an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You, O king, are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air.

Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they  all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.  <strong>3</strong> And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.  <strong>4</strong> And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.  <strong>5</strong> And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.  <strong>6</strong> And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.  <strong>7</strong> But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:  <strong>8</strong> And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.  <strong>9</strong> So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.  <strong>10</strong> But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.  <strong>11</strong> And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.  <strong>12</strong> And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.  <strong>13</strong> For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.  <strong>14</strong> And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.  <strong>15</strong> So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.  <strong>16</strong> But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.  <strong>17</strong> He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him;

he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.  <strong>31</strong> And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.  <strong>32</strong> And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.  <strong>33</strong> And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many  days.  <strong>34</strong> Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.  <strong>35</strong> And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.  <strong>36</strong> And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.  <strong>37</strong> Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.  <strong>38</strong> But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.  <strong>39</strong> Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.  <strong>40</strong> And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.  <strong>41</strong> He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries  shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even  Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.  <strong>42</strong> He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.  <strong>43</strong> But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.  <strong>44</strong> But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.  <strong>45</strong> And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I took my stand to support and protect him.) <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Now then, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will appear in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power by his wealth, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then a mighty king will appear, who will rule with great power and do as he pleases. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> After he has appeared, his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven. It will not go to his descendants, nor will it have the power he exercised, because his empire will be uprooted and given to others. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After some years, they will become allies. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an alliance, but she will not retain her power, and he and his power will not last. In those days she will be handed over, together with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and be victorious. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He will also seize their gods, their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the North alone. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will retreat to his own country. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> His sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army, which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a huge army fully equipped. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"In those times many will rise against the king of the South. The violent men among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision, but without success. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to stand against him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. And he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans will not succeed or help him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back upon him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After this, he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall, to be seen no more. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> After coming to an agreement with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did. He will distribute plunder, loot and wealth among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses-but only for a time. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"With a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will wage war with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Those who eat from the king's provisions will try to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because an end will still come at the appointed time. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his fathers he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Nubians in submission. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.

So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.  <strong>17</strong> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.  <strong>18</strong> But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.  <strong>19</strong> Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;  <strong>20</strong> And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of  the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of  that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.  <strong>21</strong> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;  <strong>22</strong> Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.  <strong>23</strong> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.  <strong>24</strong> And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.  <strong>25</strong> And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.  <strong>26</strong> But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.  <strong>27</strong> And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.  <strong>28</strong> Hitherto is the end of the matter.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Daniel said: \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Four great beasts, each different from the others, came up out of the sea. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> \"The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man, and the heart of a man was given to it. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, 'Get up and eat your fill of flesh!' <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast-terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"As I looked, \"thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was flaming with fire, and its wheels were all ablaze. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> A river of fire was flowing, coming out from before him. Thousands upon thousands attended him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated, and the books were opened. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> (The other beasts had been stripped of their authority, but were allowed to live for a period of time.) <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this. \"So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> 'The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever-yes, for ever and ever.' <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws-the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell-the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"He gave me this explanation: 'The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will worship and obey him.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"This is the end of the matter. I, Daniel, was deeply troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.\" "},{"_id":"616ca871e9d39d04b3b5fa78","topicId":"616ca86be9d39d04b3b5fa64","verse":"Isaiah 41:21-23","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p23041021_05-20\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23041021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Set forth your case, says the LORD;</span><br><span id=\"p23041021_05-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring your proofs, says the King of Jacob.</span><br><span id=\"p23041022_05-20\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23041022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them bring them, and tell us</span><br><span id=\"p23041022_05-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is to happen.</span><br><span id=\"p23041022_05-20\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us the former things, what they are,</span><br><span id=\"p23041022_05-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we may consider them,</span><br><span id=\"p23041022_05-20\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;that we may know their outcome;</span><br><span id=\"p23041022_05-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or declare to us the things to come.</span><br><span id=\"p23041023_05-20\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v23041023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell us what is to come hereafter,</span><br><span id=\"p23041023_05-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we may know that you are gods;</span><br><span id=\"p23041023_05-20\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;do good, or do harm,</span><br><span id=\"p23041023_05-20\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we may be dismayed and terrified.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>21</strong> Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons,  saith the King of Jacob.  <strong>22</strong> Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.  <strong>23</strong> Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.

And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.  <strong>5</strong> And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:  <strong>6</strong> He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.  <strong>7</strong> And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;  <strong>8</strong> And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.  <strong>9</strong> On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:  <strong>10</strong> And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,  <strong>11</strong> And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:  <strong>12</strong> Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.  <strong>13</strong> And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.  <strong>15</strong> And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.  <strong>16</strong> This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.  <strong>17</strong> Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,  <strong>18</strong> And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.  <strong>19</strong> While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.  <strong>20</strong> Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.  <strong>21</strong> Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?  <strong>22</strong> And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.  <strong>23</strong> Then called he them in, and lodged them.

Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then a voice told him, \"Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Surely not, Lord!\" Peter replied. \"I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The voice spoke to him a second time, \"Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, \"Simon, three men are looking for you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Peter went down and said to the men, \"I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men replied, \"We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along. The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> But Peter made him get up. \"Stand up,\" he said, \"I am only a man myself.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to them: \"You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cornelius answered: \"Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.' <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then Peter began to speak: \"I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.

That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time? <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,' <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
