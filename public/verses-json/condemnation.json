Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008010-1\">10&nbsp;</b>But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008011-1\">11&nbsp;</b>If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p45008011_08-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, “Abba! Father!” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p45008017_10-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008022-1\">22&nbsp;</b>For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008023-1\">23&nbsp;</b>And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008024-1\">24&nbsp;</b>For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</p>\n<p id=\"p45008025_10-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008028-1\">28&nbsp;</b>And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008029-1\">29&nbsp;</b>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008030-1\">30&nbsp;</b>And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p45008030_13-7\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008031-1\">31&nbsp;</b>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008032-1\">32&nbsp;</b>He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008033-1\">33&nbsp;</b>Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008034-1\">34&nbsp;</b>Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v45008035-1\">35&nbsp;</b>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  <strong>10</strong> And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  <strong>11</strong> But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  <strong>13</strong> For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  <strong>14</strong> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  <strong>15</strong> For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.  <strong>16</strong> The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:  <strong>17</strong> And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.  <strong>18</strong> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are  not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.  <strong>19</strong> For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.  <strong>20</strong> For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,  <strong>21</strong> Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  <strong>22</strong> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.  <strong>23</strong> And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.  <strong>24</strong> For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  <strong>25</strong> But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.  <strong>26</strong> Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.  <strong>27</strong> And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  <strong>28</strong> And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  <strong>29</strong> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be  conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  <strong>30</strong> Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.  <strong>31</strong> What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?  <strong>32</strong> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  <strong>33</strong> Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is  God that justifieth.  <strong>34</strong> Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.  <strong>35</strong> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  <strong>36</strong> As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  <strong>37</strong> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  <strong>38</strong> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,  <strong>39</strong> Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace; <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, \"Abba, Father.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As it is written: \"For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As it is written: \"I have made you a father of many nations.\" He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed--the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, \"So shall your offspring be.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead--since he was about a hundred years old--and that Sarah's womb was also dead. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> This is why \"it was credited to him as righteousness.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The words \"it was credited to him\" were written not for him alone, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
