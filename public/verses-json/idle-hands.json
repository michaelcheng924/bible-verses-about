","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to you from God our Father. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints-- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and who also told us of your love in the Spirit. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation-- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness-- <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.

Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  <strong>18</strong> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  <strong>19</strong> For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.  <strong>20</strong> For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,  ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.  <strong>21</strong> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:  <strong>22</strong> Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:  <strong>23</strong> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:  <strong>24</strong> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.  <strong>25</strong> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him-- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For in Scripture it says: \"See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, \"The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, \" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and, \"A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.\" They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
