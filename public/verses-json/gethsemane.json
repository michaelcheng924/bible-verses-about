And they said, Nothing.  <strong>36</strong> Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.  <strong>37</strong> For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.  <strong>38</strong> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. <strong>39</strong> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.  <strong>40</strong> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.  <strong>41</strong> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,  <strong>42</strong> Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.  <strong>43</strong> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.  <strong>44</strong> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.  <strong>45</strong> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,  <strong>46</strong> And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. <strong>47</strong> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.  <strong>48</strong> But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?  <strong>49</strong> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?  <strong>50</strong> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.  <strong>52</strong> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?  <strong>53</strong> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. <strong>54</strong> Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.  <strong>55</strong> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.  <strong>56</strong> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.  <strong>57</strong> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.  <strong>58</strong> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.  <strong>59</strong> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.  <strong>60</strong> And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.  <strong>61</strong> And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>62</strong> And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.  <strong>63</strong> And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.  <strong>64</strong> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?  <strong>65</strong> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.  <strong>66</strong> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,  <strong>67</strong> Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:  <strong>68</strong> And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.  <strong>69</strong> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.  <strong>70</strong> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.  <strong>71</strong> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They were delighted and agreed to give him money. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, \"Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Where do you want us to prepare for it?\" they asked. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He replied, \"As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you.

Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You are those who have stood by me in my trials. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail.

Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The disciples said, \"See, Lord, here are two swords.That is enough,\" he replied. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> On reaching the place, he said to them, \"Pray that you will not fall into temptation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Why are you sleeping?\" he asked them. \"Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.\" <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> but Jesus asked him, \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, \"Lord, should we strike with our swords?\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> But Jesus answered, \"No more of this!\" And he touched the man's ear and healed him. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, \"Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs? <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns.\" <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, \"This man was with him.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"Woman, I don't know him,\" he said. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> A little later someone else saw him and said, \"You also are one of them.Man, I am not!\" Peter replied. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> About an hour later another asserted, \"Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Man, I don't know what you're talking about!\" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> And he went outside and wept bitterly. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> They blindfolded him and demanded, \"Prophesy! Who hit you?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> And they said many other insulting things to him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"If you are the Christ, \"they said, \"tell us.\" <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"If I tell you, you will not believe me, and if I asked you, you would not answer. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> They all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied, \"You are right in saying I am.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> Then they said, \"Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips.\" "},{"_id":"6162244c9b02b3054ca4f541","topicId":"6162244b9b02b3054ca4f53f","verse":"John 18:26","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p43018026_01-2\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v43018026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>26</strong> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?

And they murmured against her.  <strong>6</strong> And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.  <strong>7</strong> For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.  <strong>8</strong> She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying.  <strong>9</strong> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her. <strong>10</strong> And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief priests, to betray him unto them.  <strong>11</strong> And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.  <strong>12</strong> And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?  <strong>13</strong> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.  <strong>14</strong> And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?  <strong>15</strong> And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and  prepared: there make ready for us.  <strong>16</strong> And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.  <strong>17</strong> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.  <strong>18</strong> And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.  <strong>19</strong> And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?  <strong>20</strong> And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dippeth with me in the dish.  <strong>21</strong> The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born. <strong>22</strong> And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.  <strong>23</strong> And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it  to them: and they all drank of it.  <strong>24</strong> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.  <strong>25</strong> Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. <strong>26</strong> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.  <strong>28</strong> But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.  <strong>29</strong> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will  not I.  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  <strong>31</strong> But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.  <strong>32</strong> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.  <strong>33</strong> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;  <strong>34</strong> And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death: tarry ye here, and watch.  <strong>35</strong> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.  <strong>36</strong> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.  <strong>37</strong> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?  <strong>38</strong> Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.  <strong>39</strong> And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.  <strong>40</strong> And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.  <strong>41</strong> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <strong>42</strong> Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand. <strong>43</strong> And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and the scribes and the elders.  <strong>44</strong> And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.  <strong>45</strong> And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and kissed him.  <strong>46</strong> And they laid their hands on him, and took him.  <strong>47</strong> And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  <strong>48</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?  <strong>49</strong> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.  <strong>50</strong> And they all forsook him, and fled.  <strong>51</strong> And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:  <strong>52</strong> And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.  <strong>53</strong> And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.  <strong>54</strong> And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.  <strong>55</strong> And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.  <strong>56</strong> For many bare false witness against him, but their witness agreed not together.  <strong>57</strong> And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying,  <strong>58</strong> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.  <strong>59</strong> But neither so did their witness agree together.  <strong>60</strong> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  <strong>61</strong> But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?  <strong>62</strong> And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.  <strong>63</strong> Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?  <strong>64</strong> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.  <strong>65</strong> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.  <strong>66</strong> And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:  <strong>67</strong> And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>68</strong> But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.  <strong>69</strong> And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.  <strong>70</strong> And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.  <strong>71</strong> But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.  <strong>72</strong> And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"But not during the Feast,\" they said, \"or the people may riot.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, \"Why this waste of perfume? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor.\" And they rebuked her harshly. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Leave her alone,\" said Jesus. \"Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, \"Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, \"Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, \"I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, \"Surely not I?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"It is one of the Twelve,\" he replied, \"one who dips bread into the bowl with me. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, \"Take it; this is my body.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,\" he said to them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"You will all fall away,\" Jesus told them, \"for it is written: \"'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Peter declared, \"Even if all fall away, I will not.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But Peter insisted emphatically, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the others said the same. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,\" he said to them. \"Stay here and keep watch.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Abba, Father,\" he said, \"everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. \"Simon,\" he said to Peter, \"are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour? <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Returning the third time, he said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: \"The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, \"Rabbi!\" and kissed him. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The men seized Jesus and arrested him. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Am I leading a rebellion,\" said Jesus, \"that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Then everyone deserted him and fled. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> \"We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> Yet even then their testimony did not agree. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, \"Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, \"Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?\" <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> \"I am,\" said Jesus. \"And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The high priest tore his clothes. \"Why do we need any more witnesses?\" he asked. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> \"You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\" <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> They all condemned him as worthy of death. Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards took him and beat him. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. \"You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,\" she said. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> But he denied it. \"I don't know or understand what you're talking about,\" he said, and went out into the entryway. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, \"Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, \"I don't know this man you're talking about.\" <sup><strong>72</strong></sup> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times.\" And he broke down and wept.
