","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> And Saul was there, giving approval to his death. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So there was great joy in that city. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, \"This man is the divine power known as the Great Power.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> and said, \"Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Peter answered: \"May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money! <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Simon answered, \"Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, \"Go south to the road--the desert road--that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The Spirit told Philip, \"Go to that chariot and stay near it.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. \"Do you understand what you are reading?\" Philip asked. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"How can I,\" he said, \"unless someone explains it to me?\" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: \"He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \"Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.

This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. \"Quick, get up!\" he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the angel said to him, \"Put on your clothes and sandals.\" And Peter did so. \"Wrap your cloak around you and follow me,\" the angel told him. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then Peter came to himself and said, \"Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, \"Peter is at the door!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"You're out of your mind,\" they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, \"It must be his angel.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. \"Tell James and the brothers about this,\" he said, and then he left for another place. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while. He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. Having secured the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king's country for their food supply. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They shouted, \"This is the voice of a god, not of a man.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But the word of God continued to increase and spread. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.

If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  <strong>18</strong> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.  <strong>19</strong> And if they were all one member, where were the body?  <strong>20</strong> But now are they many members, yet but one body.  <strong>21</strong> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.  <strong>22</strong> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:  <strong>23</strong> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.  <strong>24</strong> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:  <strong>25</strong> That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.  <strong>26</strong> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.  <strong>27</strong> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.  <strong>28</strong> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.  <strong>29</strong> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are  all teachers? are all workers of miracles?  <strong>30</strong> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?  <strong>31</strong> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, \"Jesus be cursed,\" and no one can say, \"Jesus is Lord,\" except by the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free--and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If the foot should say, \"Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And if the ear should say, \"Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If they were all one part, where would the body be? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> As it is, there are many parts, but one body. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I don't need you!\" And the head cannot say to the feet, \"I don't need you!\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.
