If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  <strong>18</strong> But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.  <strong>19</strong> And if they were all one member, where were the body?  <strong>20</strong> But now are they many members, yet but one body.  <strong>21</strong> And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.  <strong>22</strong> Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:  <strong>23</strong> And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.  <strong>24</strong> For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:  <strong>25</strong> That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.  <strong>26</strong> And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.  <strong>27</strong> Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.  <strong>28</strong> And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.  <strong>29</strong> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are  all teachers? are all workers of miracles?  <strong>30</strong> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?  <strong>31</strong> But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, \"Jesus be cursed,\" and no one can say, \"Jesus is Lord,\" except by the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free--and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If the foot should say, \"Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And if the ear should say, \"Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If they were all one part, where would the body be? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> As it is, there are many parts, but one body. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I don't need you!\" And the head cannot say to the feet, \"I don't need you!\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.

The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He must become greater; I must become less. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.\" "},{"_id":"616c903016dfdfefa20365cd","topicId":"616c902d16dfdfefa20365c4","verse":"Hosea 13:16","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p28013016_01-12\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v28013016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Samaria shall bear her guilt,</span><br><span id=\"p28013016_01-12\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because she has rebelled against her God;</span><br><span id=\"p28013016_01-12\" class=\"line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;they shall fall by the sword;</span><br><span id=\"p28013016_01-12\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their little ones shall be dashed in pieces,</span><br><span id=\"p28013016_01-12\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their pregnant women ripped open.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>16</strong> Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.
