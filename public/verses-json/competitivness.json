To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is  safe.  <strong>2</strong> Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.  <strong>3</strong> For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.  <strong>4</strong> Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:  <strong>5</strong> Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;  <strong>6</strong> Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.  <strong>7</strong> But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.  <strong>8</strong> Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,  <strong>9</strong> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:  <strong>10</strong> That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;  <strong>11</strong> If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.  <strong>12</strong> Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.  <strong>13</strong> Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this  one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,  <strong>14</strong> I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.  <strong>15</strong> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.  <strong>16</strong> Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.  <strong>17</strong> Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.  <strong>18</strong> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:  <strong>19</strong> Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)  <strong>20</strong> For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:  <strong>21</strong> Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh-- <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Only let us live up to what we have already attained. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
