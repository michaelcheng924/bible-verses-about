","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, \"Here's a good seat for you,\" but say to the poor man, \"You stand there\" or \"Sit on the floor by my feet,\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, \"Love your neighbor as yourself,\" you are doing right. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For he who said, \"Do not commit adultery,\" also said, \"Do not murder.\" If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment! <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If one of you says to him, \"Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,\" but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But someone will say, \"You have faith; I have deeds.\" Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless? <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And the scripture was fulfilled that says, \"Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,\" and he was called God's friend. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
