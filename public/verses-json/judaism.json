It was about the sixth hour. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, \"Will you give me a drink?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The Samaritan woman said to him, \"You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?\" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans. ) <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus answered her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> He told her, \"Go, call your husband and come back.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"I have no husband,\" she replied. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Jesus said to her, \"You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" the woman said, \"I can see that you are a prophet. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus declared, \"Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The woman said, \"I know that Messiah\" (called Christ) \"is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I who speak to you am he.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, \"What do you want?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They came out of the town and made their way toward him. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Meanwhile his disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat something.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"I have food to eat that you know nothing about.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then his disciples said to each other, \"Could someone have brought him food?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"My food,\" said Jesus, \"is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, \"He told me everything I ever did.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And because of his words many more became believers. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said to the woman, \"We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> After the two days he left for Galilee. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders,\" Jesus told him, \"you will never believe.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The royal official said, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"You may go. Your son will live.\" The man took Jesus at his word and departed. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, \"The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live.\" So he and all his household believed. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.

 <strong>15</strong> And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were  under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.  <strong>16</strong> For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.  <strong>17</strong> For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.  <strong>18</strong> Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.  <strong>19</strong> For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,  <strong>20</strong> Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.  <strong>21</strong> Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.  <strong>22</strong> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  <strong>23</strong> It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.  <strong>24</strong> For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:  <strong>25</strong> Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;  <strong>26</strong> For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.  <strong>27</strong> And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:  <strong>28</strong> So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.  <strong>1</strong> For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.  <strong>2</strong> For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.  <strong>3</strong> But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.  <strong>4</strong> For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.  <strong>5</strong> Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:  <strong>6</strong> In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  <strong>7</strong> Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.  <strong>8</strong> Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein; which are offered by the law;  <strong>9</strong> Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.  <strong>10</strong> By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.  <strong>11</strong> And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:  <strong>12</strong> But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;  <strong>13</strong> From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.  <strong>14</strong> For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.  <strong>15</strong> Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,  <strong>16</strong> This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;  <strong>17</strong> And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  <strong>18</strong> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.  <strong>19</strong> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,  <strong>20</strong> By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;  <strong>21</strong> And having an high priest over the house of God;  <strong>22</strong> Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.  <strong>23</strong> Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)  <strong>24</strong> And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:  <strong>25</strong> Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  <strong>26</strong> For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  <strong>27</strong> But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.  <strong>28</strong> He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:  <strong>29</strong> Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?  <strong>30</strong> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.  <strong>31</strong> It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  <strong>32</strong> But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;  <strong>33</strong> Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.  <strong>34</strong> For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.  <strong>35</strong> Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.  <strong>36</strong> For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.  <strong>37</strong> For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.  <strong>38</strong> Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.  <strong>39</strong> But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings--external regulations applying until the time of the new order.
