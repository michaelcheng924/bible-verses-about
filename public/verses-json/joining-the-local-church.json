 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?

Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.

So it is with Christ. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free--and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Now the body is not made up of one part but of many. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If the foot should say, \"Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And if the ear should say, \"Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,\" it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If they were all one part, where would the body be? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> As it is, there are many parts, but one body. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The eye cannot say to the hand, \"I don't need you!\" And the head cannot say to the feet, \"I don't need you!\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it, <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.
