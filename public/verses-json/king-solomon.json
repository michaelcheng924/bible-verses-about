A worthy man like you must be bringing good news.\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Not at all!\" Jonathan answered. \"Our lord King David has made Solomon king. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule, <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> and said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Then Solomon was told, \"Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Solomon replied, \"If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, \"Go to your home.\" ","modified":"2022-08-11T22:19:25.972Z"},{"_id":"6164f4b36451fe5325fa052f","topicId":"6164f4b36451fe5325fa052c","verse":"Proverbs 16:1-18:24","votes":-1,"__v":0,"kjv":"<strong>1</strong> The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.  <strong>2</strong> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.  <strong>3</strong> Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.  <strong>4</strong> The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.  <strong>5</strong> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.  <strong>6</strong> By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.  <strong>7</strong> When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.  <strong>8</strong> Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.  <strong>9</strong> A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.  <strong>10</strong> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.  <strong>11</strong> A just weight and balance are the LORD’S: all the weights of the bag are his work.  <strong>12</strong> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.  <strong>13</strong> Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.  <strong>14</strong> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.  <strong>15</strong> In the light of the king’s countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.  <strong>16</strong> How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!  <strong>17</strong> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.  <strong>18</strong> Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.  <strong>19</strong> Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.  <strong>20</strong> He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.  <strong>21</strong> The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.  <strong>22</strong> Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.  <strong>23</strong> The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.  <strong>24</strong> Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.  <strong>25</strong> There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.  <strong>26</strong> He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.  <strong>27</strong> An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is  as a burning fire.  <strong>28</strong> A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.  <strong>29</strong> A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.  <strong>30</strong> He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.  <strong>31</strong> The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.  <strong>32</strong> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.  <strong>33</strong> The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.  <strong>2</strong> A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.  <strong>3</strong> The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.  <strong>4</strong> A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.  <strong>5</strong> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.  <strong>6</strong> Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.  <strong>7</strong> Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.  <strong>8</strong> A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.  <strong>9</strong> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.  <strong>10</strong> A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.  <strong>11</strong> An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.  <strong>12</strong> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.  <strong>13</strong> Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.  <strong>14</strong> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.  <strong>15</strong> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?  <strong>17</strong> A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.  <strong>18</strong> A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.  <strong>19</strong> He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.  <strong>20</strong> He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.  <strong>21</strong> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.  <strong>22</strong> A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.  <strong>23</strong> A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.  <strong>24</strong> Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.  <strong>25</strong> A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.  <strong>26</strong> Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.  <strong>27</strong> He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.  <strong>28</strong> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and  he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.  <strong>1</strong> Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and  intermeddleth with all wisdom.  <strong>2</strong> A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.  <strong>3</strong> When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.  <strong>4</strong> The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and  the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.  <strong>5</strong> It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.  <strong>6</strong> A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.  <strong>7</strong> A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are  the snare of his soul.  <strong>8</strong> The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.  <strong>9</strong> He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.  <strong>10</strong> The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.  <strong>11</strong> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.  <strong>12</strong> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.  <strong>13</strong> He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.  <strong>14</strong> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?  <strong>15</strong> The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.  <strong>16</strong> A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.  <strong>17</strong> He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.  <strong>18</strong> The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.  <strong>19</strong> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.  <strong>20</strong> A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.  <strong>21</strong> Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.  <strong>22</strong> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.  <strong>23</strong> The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.  <strong>24</strong> A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> To man belong the plans of the heart, but from the LORD comes the reply of the tongue. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> All a man's ways seem innocent to him, but motives are weighed by the LORD. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and your plans will succeed. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The LORD works out everything for his own ends- even the wicked for a day of disaster. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD detests all the proud of heart.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  <strong>15</strong> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  <strong>16</strong> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. <strong>17</strong>           Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.  <strong>18</strong> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  <strong>19</strong> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <strong>21</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:  <strong>22</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.  <strong>23</strong> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;  <strong>24</strong> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.  <strong>25</strong> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  <strong>26</strong> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. <strong>27</strong>           Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:  <strong>28</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.  <strong>29</strong> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it  from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>30</strong> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.  <strong>31</strong> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:  <strong>32</strong> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery. <strong>33</strong>           Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:  <strong>34</strong> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  <strong>35</strong> Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.  <strong>36</strong> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.  <strong>37</strong> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. <strong>38</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:  <strong>39</strong> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.  <strong>40</strong> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.  <strong>41</strong> And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.  <strong>42</strong> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. <strong>43</strong>           Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.  <strong>44</strong> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  <strong>45</strong> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  <strong>46</strong> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  <strong>47</strong> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  <strong>48</strong> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. <strong>1</strong>           Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.  <strong>2</strong> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>3</strong> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  <strong>4</strong> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <strong>5</strong>           And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  <strong>7</strong> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  <strong>8</strong> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  <strong>9</strong> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  <strong>10</strong> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is  in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> Give us this day our daily bread.  <strong>12</strong> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  <strong>13</strong> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  <strong>14</strong> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:  <strong>15</strong> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <strong>16</strong>           Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>17</strong> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  <strong>18</strong> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  <strong>19</strong>           Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  <strong>20</strong> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:  <strong>21</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>22</strong> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  <strong>23</strong> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is  that darkness! <strong>24</strong>           No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  <strong>26</strong> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  <strong>27</strong> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  <strong>28</strong> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:  <strong>29</strong> And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  <strong>31</strong> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  <strong>32</strong> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  <strong>33</strong> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>34</strong> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. <strong>1</strong>           Judge not, that ye be not judged.  <strong>2</strong> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  <strong>3</strong> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  <strong>4</strong> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?  <strong>5</strong> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.  <strong>6</strong>           Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. <strong>7</strong>           Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:  <strong>8</strong> For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  <strong>9</strong> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?  <strong>10</strong> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  <strong>11</strong> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?  <strong>12</strong> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. <strong>13</strong>           Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:  <strong>14</strong> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is  the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. <strong>15</strong>           Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  <strong>16</strong> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  <strong>17</strong> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  <strong>18</strong> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  <strong>19</strong> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. <strong>21</strong>           Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>22</strong> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  <strong>23</strong> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <strong>24</strong>           Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:  <strong>25</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  <strong>26</strong> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:  <strong>27</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.  <strong>28</strong> And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:  <strong>29</strong> For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.  <strong>1</strong> When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.  <strong>2</strong> And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <strong>3</strong> And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  <strong>4</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. <strong>5</strong> And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a centurion, beseeching him,  <strong>6</strong> And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.  <strong>7</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.  <strong>8</strong> The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.  <strong>9</strong> For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.  <strong>10</strong> When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.  <strong>11</strong> And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.  <strong>12</strong> But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  <strong>13</strong> And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.  <strong>14</strong> And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.  <strong>15</strong> And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered unto them.  <strong>16</strong> When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:  <strong>17</strong> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  <strong>18</strong> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart unto the other side.  <strong>19</strong> And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  <strong>20</strong> And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.  <strong>21</strong> And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  <strong>22</strong> But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead. <strong>23</strong> And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.  <strong>24</strong> And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.  <strong>25</strong> And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.  <strong>26</strong> And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.  <strong>27</strong> But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!  <strong>28</strong> And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.  <strong>29</strong> And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?  <strong>30</strong> And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.  <strong>31</strong> So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.  <strong>32</strong> And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.  <strong>33</strong> And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.  <strong>34</strong> And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.
