You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have provoked me to anger and thrust me behind your back. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"'Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel-slave or free. I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country. The LORD has spoken!' <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the LORD, the God of Israel, has found anything good. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"The LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Yes, even now. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And the LORD will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their forefathers and scatter them beyond the River, because they provoked the LORD to anger by making Asherah poles. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Jeroboam's wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the LORD had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah.
