Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do your best to come to me quickly, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: \"How can Satan drive out Satan? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> He said this because they were saying, \"He has an evil spirit.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, \"Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"Who are my mother and my brothers?\" he asked. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, \"Here are my mother and my brothers! <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother.\" "},{"_id":"616dbd7775868033c71055e6","topicId":"616dbd6f75868033c71055cd","verse":"Matthew 6:7","votes":7,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p40006007_01-28\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v40006007-1\">7&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>7</strong> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
