Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: \"The Lord knows those who are his,\" and, \"Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
