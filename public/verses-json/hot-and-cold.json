For the LORD has spoken: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" ","modified":"2022-07-25T08:39:58.144Z"},{"_id":"616260e6fb3956153170e819","topicId":"616260e3fb3956153170e811","verse":"Luke 17:30","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p42017030_01-10\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v42017030-1\">30&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</span></p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>30</strong> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.  <strong>11</strong> And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.  <strong>12</strong> His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were  many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.  <strong>13</strong> And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.  <strong>14</strong> And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.  <strong>15</strong> And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.  <strong>16</strong> And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.  <strong>17</strong> And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God;  <strong>18</strong> That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.  <strong>19</strong> And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.  <strong>20</strong> And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.  <strong>21</strong> And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.  <strong>1</strong> And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.  <strong>2</strong> And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,  <strong>3</strong> And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.  <strong>4</strong> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  <strong>5</strong> But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.  <strong>6</strong> Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.  <strong>7</strong> And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,  <strong>8</strong> And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.  <strong>9</strong> And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.  <strong>10</strong> And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  <strong>11</strong> And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.  <strong>12</strong> And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.  <strong>13</strong> And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.  <strong>14</strong> And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.  <strong>15</strong> And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  <strong>1</strong> And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.  <strong>2</strong> And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.  <strong>3</strong> And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.  <strong>4</strong> And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.  <strong>5</strong> And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely.  <strong>7</strong> He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  <strong>8</strong> But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.  <strong>9</strong> And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.  <strong>10</strong> And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,  <strong>11</strong> Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;  <strong>12</strong> And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names  of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:  <strong>13</strong> On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.  <strong>14</strong> And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.  <strong>15</strong> And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.  <strong>16</strong> And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.  <strong>17</strong> And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.  <strong>18</strong> And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.  <strong>19</strong> And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;  <strong>20</strong> The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.  <strong>21</strong> And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.  <strong>22</strong> And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.  <strong>23</strong> And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.  <strong>24</strong> And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.  <strong>25</strong> And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.  <strong>26</strong> And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it.  <strong>27</strong> And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.  <strong>1</strong> And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.  <strong>2</strong> In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner  of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.  <strong>3</strong> And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:  <strong>4</strong> And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.  <strong>5</strong> And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.  <strong>6</strong> And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.  <strong>7</strong> Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book.  <strong>8</strong> And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things.  <strong>9</strong> Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.  <strong>10</strong> And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.  <strong>11</strong> He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.  <strong>12</strong> And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.  <strong>13</strong> I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.  <strong>14</strong> Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.  <strong>15</strong> For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.  <strong>16</strong>           I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. <strong>17</strong> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.  <strong>18</strong> For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:  <strong>19</strong> And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.  <strong>20</strong> He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.  Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.  <strong>21</strong> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse: Grace and peace to you from God our Father. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints-- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and who also told us of your love in the Spirit. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation-- <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness-- <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.
