And he answered, Go ye.  <strong>3</strong> And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go.  <strong>4</strong> So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood.  <strong>5</strong> But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed.  <strong>6</strong> And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.  <strong>7</strong> Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it.  <strong>8</strong> Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.  <strong>9</strong> And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down.  <strong>10</strong> And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?  <strong>12</strong> And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.  <strong>13</strong> And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.  <strong>15</strong> And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do?  <strong>16</strong> And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.  <strong>17</strong> And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.  <strong>18</strong> And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.  <strong>19</strong> And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.  <strong>20</strong> And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.  <strong>21</strong> And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?  <strong>22</strong> And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master.  <strong>23</strong> And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.  <strong>24</strong> And it came to pass after this, that Ben-hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.  <strong>25</strong> And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces  of silver.  <strong>26</strong> And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.  <strong>27</strong> And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?  <strong>28</strong> And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.  <strong>29</strong> So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son.  <strong>30</strong> And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.  <strong>31</strong> Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.  <strong>32</strong> But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?  <strong>33</strong> And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer?  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The company of the prophets said to Elisha, \"Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to live.\" And he said, \"Go.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then one of them said, \"Won't you please come with your servants?I will,\" Elisha replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. \"Oh, my lord,\" he cried out, \"it was borrowed!\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The man of God asked, \"Where did it fall?\" When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"Lift it out,\" he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, \"I will set up my camp in such and such a place.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The man of God sent word to the king of Israel: \"Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, \"Will you not tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"None of us, my lord the king,\" said one of his officers, \"but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Go, find out where he is,\" the king ordered, \"so I can send men and capture him.\" The report came back: \"He is in Dothan.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. \"Oh, my lord, what shall we do?\" the servant asked. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Don't be afraid,\" the prophet answered. \"Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And Elisha prayed, \"O LORD, open his eyes so he may see.\" Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, \"Strike these people with blindness.\" So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Elisha told them, \"This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for.\" And he led them to Samaria. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> After they entered the city, Elisha said, \"LORD, open the eyes of these men so they can see.\" Then the LORD opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, \"Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Do not kill them,\" he answered. \"Would you kill men you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, \"Help me, my lord the king!\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The king replied, \"If the LORD does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then he asked her, \"What's the matter?\" She answered, \"This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Give up your son so we may eat him,' but she had hidden him.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and there, underneath, he had sackcloth on his body. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> He said, \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, \"Don't you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head?

","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer--at three in the afternoon. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, \"Look at us!\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> When all the people saw him walking and praising God, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> While the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When Peter saw this, he said to them: \"Men of Israel, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him, as you can all see. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Christ would suffer. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you--even Jesus. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers.
