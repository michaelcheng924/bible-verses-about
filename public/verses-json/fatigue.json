Again you will take up your tambourines and go out to dance with the joyful. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy their fruit. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim, 'Come, let us go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.'\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, 'O LORD, save your people, the remnant of Israel.' <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> See, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, expectant mothers and women in labor; a great throng will return. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They will come with weeping; they will pray as I bring them back. I will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble, because I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn son. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"Hear the word of the LORD, O nations; proclaim it in distant coastlands: 'He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.' <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> For the LORD will ransom Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will rejoice in the bounty of the LORD - the grain, the new wine and the oil, the young of the flocks and herds. They will be like a well-watered garden, and they will sorrow no more. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then maidens will dance and be glad, young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into gladness; I will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I will satisfy the priests with abundance, and my people will be filled with my bounty,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"A voice is heard in Ramah, mourning and great weeping, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because her children are no more.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"Restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded,\" declares the LORD. \"They will return from the land of the enemy. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So there is hope for your future,\" declares the LORD. \"Your children will return to their own land. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"I have surely heard Ephraim's moaning: 'You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been disciplined. Restore me, and I will return, because you are the LORD my God. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After I strayed, I repented; after I came to understand, I beat my breast. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I have great compassion for him,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Take note of the highway, the road that you take. Return, O Virgin Israel, return to your towns. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> How long will you wander, O unfaithful daughter? The LORD will create a new thing on earth- a woman will surround a man.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: \"When I bring them back from captivity, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: 'The LORD bless you, O righteous dwelling, O sacred mountain.' <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> People will live together in Judah and all its towns-farmers and those who move about with their flocks. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At this I awoke and looked around.
