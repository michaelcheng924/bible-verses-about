Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The eunuch asked Philip, \"Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, \"Look, here is water.

Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
