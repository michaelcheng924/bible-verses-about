King Nebuchadnezzar your father-your father the king, I say-appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, astrologers and diviners. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> This man Daniel, whom the king called Belteshazzar, was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding, and also the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, \"Are you Daniel, one of the exiles my father the king brought from Judah? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, intelligence and outstanding wisdom. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not explain it. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Now I have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then Daniel answered the king, \"You may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"O king, the Most High God gave your father Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Because of the high position he gave him, all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him. Those the king wanted to put to death, he put to death; those he wanted to spare, he spared; those he wanted to promote, he promoted; and those he wanted to humble, he humbled. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle; and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"But you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself, though you knew all this. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven. You had the goblets from his temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand your life and all your ways. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"This is the inscription that was written: Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"This is what these words mean: Mene: God has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Peres: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then at Belshazzar's command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That very night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonians, was slain, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.

do not even the publicans the same?  <strong>47</strong> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  <strong>48</strong> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. <strong>1</strong>           Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.  <strong>2</strong> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>3</strong> But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:  <strong>4</strong> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. <strong>5</strong>           And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>6</strong> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.  <strong>7</strong> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.  <strong>8</strong> Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.  <strong>9</strong> After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.  <strong>10</strong> Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is  in heaven.  <strong>11</strong> Give us this day our daily bread.  <strong>12</strong> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.  <strong>13</strong> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.  <strong>14</strong> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:  <strong>15</strong> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. <strong>16</strong>           Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.  <strong>17</strong> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;  <strong>18</strong> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.  <strong>19</strong>           Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:  <strong>20</strong> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:  <strong>21</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>22</strong> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  <strong>23</strong> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is  that darkness! <strong>24</strong>           No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?  <strong>26</strong> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?  <strong>27</strong> Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  <strong>28</strong> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:  <strong>29</strong> And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  <strong>30</strong> Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  <strong>31</strong> Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?  <strong>32</strong> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.  <strong>33</strong> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>34</strong> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. <strong>1</strong>           Judge not, that ye be not judged.  <strong>2</strong> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  <strong>3</strong> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  <strong>4</strong> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?  <strong>5</strong> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.  <strong>6</strong>           Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you. <strong>7</strong>           Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:  <strong>8</strong> For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.  <strong>9</strong> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?  <strong>10</strong> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  <strong>11</strong> If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?  <strong>12</strong> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets. <strong>13</strong>           Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:  <strong>14</strong> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is  the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. <strong>15</strong>           Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.  <strong>16</strong> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?  <strong>17</strong> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.  <strong>18</strong> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can  a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.  <strong>19</strong> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.  <strong>20</strong> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. <strong>21</strong>           Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>22</strong> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  <strong>23</strong> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. <strong>24</strong>           Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:  <strong>25</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.  <strong>26</strong> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:  <strong>27</strong> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.  <strong>28</strong> And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:  <strong>29</strong> For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and he began to teach them saying: <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
