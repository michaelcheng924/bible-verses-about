","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then the LORD said, \"My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Nephilim were on the earth in those days-and also afterward-when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So the LORD said, \"I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth-men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air-for I am grieved that I have made them.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So God said to Noah, \"I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark-you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
