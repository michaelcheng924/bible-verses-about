and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.  <strong>14</strong> Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,  <strong>15</strong> And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.  <strong>16</strong> Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.  <strong>17</strong> And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.  <strong>18</strong> And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.  <strong>19</strong> And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.  <strong>20</strong> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.  <strong>21</strong> And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.  <strong>22</strong> And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.  <strong>23</strong> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,  <strong>24</strong> Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.  <strong>25</strong> And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.  <strong>26</strong> And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.  <strong>27</strong> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.  <strong>28</strong> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.  <strong>29</strong> And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.  <strong>30</strong> But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.  <strong>31</strong> And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.  <strong>32</strong> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.  <strong>33</strong> And all the city was gathered together at the door.  <strong>34</strong> And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.  <strong>35</strong> And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.  <strong>36</strong> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.  <strong>37</strong> And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men  seek for thee.  <strong>38</strong> And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.  <strong>39</strong> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.  <strong>40</strong> And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.  <strong>41</strong> And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.  <strong>42</strong> And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.  <strong>43</strong> And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;  <strong>44</strong> And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.  <strong>45</strong> But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> It is written in Isaiah the prophet: \"I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way\"-- <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> And this was his message: \"After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And a voice came from heaven: \"You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"The time has come,\" he said. \"The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Come, follow me,\" Jesus said, \"and I will make you fishers of men.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> At once they left their nets and followed him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Be quiet!\" said Jesus sternly. \"Come out of him!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, \"What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> The whole town gathered at the door, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Simon and his companions went to look for him, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> and when they found him, they exclaimed: \"Everyone is looking for you!\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus replied, \"Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
