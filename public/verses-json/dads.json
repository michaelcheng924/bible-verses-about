Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.  <strong>12</strong> But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.  <strong>13</strong> Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is  full of sheaves.  <strong>14</strong> Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:  <strong>15</strong> Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is  swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.  <strong>16</strong> And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying,  <strong>2</strong> You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.  <strong>3</strong> Can two walk together, except they be agreed?  <strong>4</strong> Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?  <strong>5</strong> Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is  for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?  <strong>6</strong> Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not done it?  <strong>7</strong> Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.  <strong>8</strong> The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath spoken, who can but prophesy?  <strong>9</strong> Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof.  <strong>10</strong> For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.  <strong>11</strong> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be  even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.  <strong>12</strong> Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in  a couch.  <strong>13</strong> Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord GOD, the God of hosts,  <strong>14</strong> That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.  <strong>15</strong> And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, saith the LORD.  <strong>1</strong> Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.  <strong>2</strong> The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.  <strong>3</strong> And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is  before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.  <strong>4</strong> Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years:  <strong>5</strong> And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.  <strong>6</strong> And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  <strong>7</strong> And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were  yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.  <strong>8</strong> So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  <strong>9</strong> I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  <strong>10</strong> I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  <strong>11</strong> I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.  <strong>12</strong> Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.  <strong>13</strong> For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.
