LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:  <strong>2</strong> And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;  <strong>3</strong> The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.  <strong>4</strong> I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.  <strong>5</strong> When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;  <strong>6</strong> The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;  <strong>7</strong> In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.  <strong>8</strong> Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.  <strong>9</strong> There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.  <strong>10</strong> He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was  under his feet.  <strong>11</strong> And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.  <strong>12</strong> And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and  thick clouds of the skies.  <strong>13</strong> Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.  <strong>14</strong> The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.  <strong>15</strong> And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.  <strong>16</strong> And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.  <strong>17</strong> He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;  <strong>18</strong> He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.  <strong>19</strong> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.  <strong>20</strong> He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.  <strong>22</strong> For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.  <strong>23</strong> For all his judgments were before me: and as for  his statutes, I did not depart from them.  <strong>24</strong> I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.  <strong>26</strong> With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.  <strong>27</strong> With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.  <strong>28</strong> And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are  upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.  <strong>29</strong> For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.  <strong>30</strong> For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.  <strong>31</strong> As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.  <strong>32</strong> For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?  <strong>33</strong> God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.  <strong>34</strong> He maketh my feet like hinds feet: and setteth me upon my high places.  <strong>35</strong> He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.  <strong>36</strong> Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.  <strong>37</strong> Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.  <strong>38</strong> I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.  <strong>39</strong> And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.  <strong>40</strong> For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.  <strong>41</strong> Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.  <strong>42</strong> They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.  <strong>43</strong> Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.  <strong>44</strong> Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.  <strong>45</strong> Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.  <strong>47</strong> The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.  <strong>48</strong> It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,  <strong>49</strong> And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.  <strong>50</strong> Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD,

Jesus saith unto them, I amhe. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.  <strong>6</strong> As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.  <strong>7</strong> Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.  <strong>8</strong> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:  <strong>9</strong> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.  <strong>10</strong> Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.  <strong>11</strong> Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?  <strong>12</strong> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,  <strong>13</strong> And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.  <strong>14</strong> Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.  <strong>15</strong> And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.  <strong>16</strong> But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.  <strong>17</strong> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.  <strong>18</strong> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.  <strong>19</strong> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.  <strong>20</strong> Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.  <strong>21</strong> Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.  <strong>22</strong> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?  <strong>23</strong> Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?  <strong>24</strong> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.  <strong>25</strong> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it,  and said, I am not.  <strong>26</strong> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?  <strong>27</strong> Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.  <strong>28</strong> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.  <strong>29</strong> Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?  <strong>30</strong> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.  <strong>31</strong> Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:  <strong>32</strong> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.  <strong>33</strong> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  <strong>34</strong> Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?  <strong>35</strong> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  <strong>36</strong> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.  <strong>37</strong> Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.  <strong>38</strong> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.  <strong>39</strong> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  <strong>40</strong> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" they replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I am he,\" Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.) When Jesus said, \"I am he,\" they drew back and fell to the ground. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Again he asked them, \"Who is it you want?\" And they said, \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I told you that I am he,\" Jesus answered. \"If you are looking for me, then let these men go.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: \"I have not lost one of those you gave me.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.) <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus commanded Peter, \"Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have spoken openly to the world,\" Jesus replied. \"I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\" he demanded. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"If I said something wrong,\" Jesus replied, \"testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Pilate came out to them and asked, \"What charges are you bringing against this man?\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> \"If he were not a criminal,\" they replied, \"we would not have handed him over to you.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Pilate said, \"Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"But we have no right to execute anyone,\" the Jews objected. This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Is that your own idea,\" Jesus asked, \"or did others talk to you about me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Am I a Jew?\" Pilate replied. \"It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"You are a king, then!\" said Pilate. Jesus answered, \"You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"What is truth?\" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, \"I find no basis for a charge against him. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> They shouted back, \"No, not him! Give us Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.
