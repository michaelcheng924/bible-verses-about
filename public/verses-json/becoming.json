And she said, Yea, for so much.  <strong>9</strong> Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.  <strong>10</strong> Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her  forth, buried her by her husband.  <strong>11</strong> And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.  <strong>12</strong> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.  <strong>13</strong> And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.  <strong>14</strong> And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)  <strong>15</strong> Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.  <strong>16</strong> There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.  <strong>17</strong> Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,  <strong>18</strong> And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.  <strong>19</strong> But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,  <strong>20</strong> Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.  <strong>21</strong> And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought.  <strong>22</strong> But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,  <strong>23</strong> Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.  <strong>24</strong> Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.  <strong>25</strong> Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.  <strong>26</strong> Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.  <strong>27</strong> And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,  <strong>28</strong> Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.  <strong>29</strong> Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.  <strong>30</strong> The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.  <strong>31</strong> Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.  <strong>32</strong> And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.  <strong>33</strong> When they heard that, they were cut to the heart,  and took counsel to slay them.  <strong>34</strong> Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;  <strong>35</strong> And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.  <strong>36</strong> For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.  <strong>37</strong> After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even  as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.  <strong>38</strong> And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:  <strong>39</strong> But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.  <strong>40</strong> And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.  <strong>41</strong> And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.  <strong>42</strong> And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Peter said, \"Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Peter asked her, \"Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?Yes,\" she said, \"that is the price.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Peter said to her, \"How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon's Colonnade. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and all of them were healed. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Go, stand in the temple courts,\" he said, \"and tell the people the full message of this new life.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin--the full assembly of the elders of Israel--and sent to the jail for the apostles. But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported, <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled, wondering what would come of this. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Then someone came and said, \"Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\" he said. \"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Peter and the other apostles replied: \"We must obey God rather than men! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead--whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then he addressed them: \"Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.
