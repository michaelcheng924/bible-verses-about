And the evening and the morning were the second day.  <strong>9</strong> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  <strong>10</strong> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>11</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>12</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>13</strong> And the evening and the morning were the third day.  <strong>14</strong> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  <strong>15</strong> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  <strong>16</strong> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  <strong>17</strong> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  <strong>18</strong> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>19</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  <strong>20</strong> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.  <strong>21</strong> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>22</strong> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.  <strong>23</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.  <strong>24</strong> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  <strong>25</strong> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.  <strong>26</strong> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.  <strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.  <strong>28</strong> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  <strong>29</strong> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  <strong>30</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.  <strong>31</strong> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was  very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> God called the light \"day,\" and the darkness he called \"night.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the first day. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> God called the expanse \"sky.\" And there was evening, and there was morning-the second day. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> God called the dry ground \"land,\" and the gathered waters he called \"seas.\" And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> God made two great lights-the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fourth day. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> God blessed them and said, \"Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And God said, \"Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then God said, \"Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> God blessed them and said to them, \"Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then God said, \"I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground-everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food.\" And it was so. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.

But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.  <strong>46</strong> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.  <strong>47</strong> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.  <strong>48</strong> I am that bread of life.  <strong>49</strong> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  <strong>50</strong> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.  <strong>51</strong> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.  <strong>52</strong> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  <strong>53</strong> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.  <strong>54</strong> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  <strong>55</strong> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.  <strong>56</strong> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.  <strong>57</strong> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.  <strong>58</strong> This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.  <strong>59</strong> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.  <strong>60</strong> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,  said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  <strong>61</strong> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?  <strong>62</strong> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  <strong>63</strong> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.  <strong>64</strong> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.  <strong>65</strong> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father. <strong>66</strong> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.  <strong>67</strong> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  <strong>68</strong> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.  <strong>69</strong> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.  <strong>70</strong> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?  <strong>71</strong> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The Jewish Passover Feast was near. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, \"Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Philip answered him, \"Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"Have the people sit down.\" There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, \"Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"It is I; don't be afraid.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, \"Rabbi, when did you get here?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Then they asked him, \"What must we do to do the works God requires?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So they asked him, \"What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> \"Sir,\" they said, \"from now on give us this bread.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then Jesus declared, \"I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, \"I am the bread that came down from heaven.\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They said, \"Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?\" <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> \"Stop grumbling among yourselves,\" Jesus answered. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> I am the bread of life. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, \"How can this man give us his flesh to eat?\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever.\" <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, \"This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, \"Does this offend you? <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before! <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Yet there are some of you who do not believe.\" For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> He went on to say, \"This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.\" <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> \"You do not want to leave too, do you?\" Jesus asked the Twelve. <sup><strong>68</strong></sup> Simon Peter answered him, \"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. <sup><strong>69</strong></sup> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\" <sup><strong>70</strong></sup> Then Jesus replied, \"Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!\" <sup><strong>71</strong></sup> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.) "}]}
