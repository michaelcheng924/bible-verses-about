What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.  <strong>23</strong> For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:  <strong>24</strong> And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.  <strong>25</strong> After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.  <strong>26</strong> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.  <strong>27</strong> Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  <strong>28</strong> But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that  bread, and drink of that cup.  <strong>29</strong> For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.  <strong>30</strong> For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.  <strong>31</strong> For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.  <strong>32</strong> But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.  <strong>33</strong> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.  <strong>34</strong> And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not! <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, \"This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
