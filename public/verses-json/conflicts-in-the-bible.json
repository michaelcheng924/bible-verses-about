 <strong>26</strong> Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.  <strong>27</strong> By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.  <strong>28</strong> Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.  <strong>29</strong> By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land:  which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.  <strong>30</strong> By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.  <strong>31</strong> By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.  <strong>32</strong> And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae;

that they might obtain a better resurrection:  <strong>36</strong> And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:  <strong>37</strong> They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;  <strong>38</strong> (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.  <strong>39</strong> And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:  <strong>40</strong> God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> This is what the ancients were commended for. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son, <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> even though God had said to him, \"It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated-- <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.

 <strong>8</strong> And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  <strong>9</strong> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,  <strong>10</strong> Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,  <strong>11</strong> Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.  <strong>12</strong> And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?  <strong>13</strong> Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.  <strong>14</strong> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:  <strong>15</strong> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but  the third hour of the day.  <strong>16</strong> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;  <strong>17</strong> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:  <strong>18</strong> And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:  <strong>19</strong> And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:  <strong>20</strong> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:  <strong>21</strong> And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.  <strong>22</strong> Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:  <strong>23</strong> Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:  <strong>24</strong> Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  <strong>25</strong> For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:  <strong>26</strong> Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:  <strong>27</strong> Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.  <strong>28</strong> Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.  <strong>29</strong> Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;  <strong>31</strong> He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.  <strong>32</strong> This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.  <strong>33</strong> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.  <strong>34</strong> For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,  <strong>35</strong> Until I make thy foes thy footstool.  <strong>36</strong> Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.  <strong>37</strong> Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?  <strong>38</strong> Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  <strong>39</strong> For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.  <strong>40</strong> And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.  <strong>41</strong> Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.  <strong>42</strong> And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.  <strong>43</strong> And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.  <strong>44</strong> And all that believed were together, and had all things common;  <strong>45</strong> And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,  as every man had need.  <strong>46</strong> And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,  <strong>47</strong> Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Utterly amazed, they asked: \"Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, \"What does this mean?\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Some, however, made fun of them and said, \"They have had too much wine. \" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: \"Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> These men are not drunk, as you suppose.

Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, \"'The Lord said to my Lord: \"Sit at my right hand <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.\"' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \"Brothers, what shall we do?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, \"Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> All the believers were together and had everything in common. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

What sayest thou of thyself?  <strong>23</strong> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.  <strong>24</strong> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.  <strong>25</strong> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  <strong>26</strong> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;  <strong>27</strong> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  <strong>28</strong> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.  <strong>29</strong> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.  <strong>30</strong> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.  <strong>31</strong> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.  <strong>32</strong> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.  <strong>33</strong> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.  <strong>34</strong> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.  <strong>35</strong> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;  <strong>36</strong> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  <strong>37</strong> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.  <strong>38</strong> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  <strong>39</strong> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.  <strong>40</strong> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  <strong>41</strong> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.  <strong>42</strong> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.  <strong>43</strong> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.  <strong>44</strong> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.  <strong>45</strong> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.  <strong>47</strong> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  <strong>48</strong> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.  <strong>49</strong> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.  <strong>50</strong> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.  <strong>51</strong> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He was with God in the beginning. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of men. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only,, who is at the Father's side, has made him known. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ. \" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Finally they said, \"Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, \"I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Now some Pharisees who had been sent <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> questioned him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"I baptize with water,\" John replied, \"but among you stands one you do not know. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, \"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.' <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Then John gave this testimony: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, \"Look, the Lamb of God!\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, \"What do you want?\" They said, \"Rabbi\" (which means Teacher), \"where are you staying?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Come,\" he replied, \"and you will see.\" So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, \"We have found the Messiah\" (that is, the Christ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \"You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas\" (which, when translated, is Peter ). <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, \"Follow me.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Philip found Nathanael and told him, \"We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?\" Nathanael asked. \"Come and see,\" said Philip. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, \"Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false.\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> \"How do you know me?\" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, \"I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Then Nathanael declared, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Jesus said, \"You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that.\" <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> He then added, \"I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\" "},{"_id":"615b9fab7d79181a31670ddb","topicId":"615b9fa37d79181a31670dc4","verse":"Mark 15:25","votes":1,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p41015025_01-25\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41015025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>And it was the third hour when they crucified him.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>25</strong> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
