This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> There is no fear in love.

hath he made mention of my name.  <strong>2</strong> And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;  <strong>3</strong> And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.  <strong>4</strong> Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.  <strong>5</strong> And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be  his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.  <strong>6</strong> And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.  <strong>7</strong> Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.  <strong>8</strong> Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;  <strong>9</strong> That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are  in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.  <strong>10</strong> They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.  <strong>11</strong> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.  <strong>12</strong> Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.  <strong>13</strong> Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.  <strong>14</strong> But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me.  <strong>15</strong> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.  <strong>16</strong> Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.  <strong>17</strong> Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.  <strong>18</strong> Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.  <strong>19</strong> For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.  <strong>20</strong> The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.  <strong>21</strong> Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?  <strong>22</strong> Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their  shoulders.  <strong>23</strong> And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.  <strong>24</strong> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?  <strong>25</strong> But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.  <strong>26</strong> And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Listen to me, you islands; hear this, you distant nations: Before I was born the LORD called me; from my birth he has made mention of my name. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> He said to me, \"You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But I said, \"I have labored to no purpose; I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing. Yet what is due me is in the LORD's hand, and my reward is with my God.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And now the LORD says- he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has been my strength- <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> he says: \"It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says- the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel- to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers: \"Kings will see you and rise up, princes will see and bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> This is what the LORD says: \"In the time of my favor I will answer you, and in the day of salvation I will help you; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances, <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> to say to the captives, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Be free!'\"They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> See, they will come from afar- some from the north, some from the west, some from the region of Aswan. \" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Shout for joy, O heavens; rejoice, O earth; burst into song, O mountains! For the LORD comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But Zion said, \"The LORD has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before me. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Your sons hasten back, and those who laid you waste depart from you. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Lift up your eyes and look around; all your sons gather and come to you. As surely as I live,\" declares the LORD, \"you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Though you were ruined and made desolate and your land laid waste, now you will be too small for your people, and those who devoured you will be far away. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The children born during your bereavement will yet say in your hearing, 'This place is too small for us; give us more space to live in.' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Then you will say in your heart, 'Who bore me these? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these-where have they come from?'\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> This is what the Sovereign LORD says: \"See, I will beckon to the Gentiles, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who hope in me will not be disappointed.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Can plunder be taken from warriors, or captives rescued from the fierce? <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But this is what the LORD says: \"Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine.

judgment to the Gentiles.  <strong>2</strong> He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.  <strong>3</strong> A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.  <strong>4</strong> He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.  <strong>5</strong> Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:  <strong>6</strong> I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;  <strong>7</strong> To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.  <strong>8</strong> I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.  <strong>9</strong> Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.  <strong>10</strong> Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.  <strong>11</strong> Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,  the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.  <strong>12</strong> Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.  <strong>13</strong> The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.  <strong>14</strong> I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and  refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.  <strong>15</strong> I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.  <strong>16</strong> And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.  <strong>17</strong> They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.  <strong>18</strong> Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.  <strong>19</strong> Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD’S servant?  <strong>20</strong> Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.  <strong>21</strong> The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.  <strong>22</strong> But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are  all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.  <strong>23</strong> Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear for the time to come?  <strong>24</strong> Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.  <strong>25</strong> Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.

In faithfulness he will bring forth justice; <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands will put their hope.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> This is what God the LORD says- he who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and all that comes out of it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand.

Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim his praise in the islands. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD will march out like a mighty man, like a warrior he will stir up his zeal; with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But those who trust in idols, who say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see! <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me, blind like the servant of the LORD? <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> You have seen many things, but have paid no attention; your ears are open, but you hear nothing.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> It pleased the LORD for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, \"Send them back.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come? <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
