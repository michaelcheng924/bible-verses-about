She got up at once and began to wait on them. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, \"You are the Son of God!\" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> But he said, \"I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
