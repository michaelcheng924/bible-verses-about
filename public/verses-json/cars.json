It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws. The saints will be handed over to him for a time, times and half a time. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"'But the court will sit, and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then the sovereignty, power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints, the people of the Most High.
