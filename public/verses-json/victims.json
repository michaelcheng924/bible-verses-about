We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Won't their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us give our consent to them, and they will settle among us.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, \"You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But they replied, \"Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?\" "},{"_id":"616cd553e9d39d04b3b60006","topicId":"616cd54fe9d39d04b3b5fff9","verse":"2 Peter 1:19-21","votes":5,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p61001019_01-13\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v61001019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>And we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v61001020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v61001021-1\">21&nbsp;</b>For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>19</strong> We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:  <strong>20</strong> Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.  <strong>21</strong> For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <strong>2</strong> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.  <strong>27</strong> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.  <strong>28</strong> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be

They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me.

Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"616cd555e9d39d04b3b6000b","topicId":"616cd54fe9d39d04b3b5fff9","verse":"2 Kings 14:13","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p12014013_01-18\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v12014013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>And Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem for four hundred cubits, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate.</p>\n\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>13</strong> And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.  <strong>5</strong> And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.  <strong>6</strong> So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.  <strong>7</strong> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house, and dress him meat.  <strong>8</strong> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.  <strong>9</strong> And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.  <strong>10</strong> And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.  <strong>11</strong> And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.  <strong>12</strong> And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.  <strong>13</strong> And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.  <strong>14</strong> Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.  <strong>15</strong> Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.  <strong>16</strong> And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.  <strong>17</strong> Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.  <strong>18</strong> And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.  <strong>19</strong> And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.  <strong>20</strong> And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing.

Jonadab was a very shrewd man. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He asked Amnon, \"Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?\" Amnon said to him, \"I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Go to bed and pretend to be ill,\" Jonadab said. \"When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, \"I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> David sent word to Tamar at the palace: \"Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. \"Send everyone out of here,\" Amnon said. So everyone left him. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then Amnon said to Tamar, \"Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand.\" And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, \"Come to bed with me, my sister.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"Don't, my brother!\" she said to him. \"Don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, \"Get up and get out!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"No!\" she said to him. \"Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me.\" But he refused to listen to her. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He called his personal servant and said, \"Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Her brother Absalom said to her, \"Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart.\" And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When King David heard all this, he was furious. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Absalom went to the king and said, \"Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"No, my son,\" the king replied. \"All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you.\" Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then Absalom said, \"If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us.\" The king asked him, \"Why should he go with you?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Absalom ordered his men, \"Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> While they were on their way, the report came to David: \"Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, \"My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, \"I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Jonadab said to the king, \"See, the king's sons are here; it has happened just as your servant said.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned for his son every day. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And the spirit of the king longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.
