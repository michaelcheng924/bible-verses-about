The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, \"He's dead.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, \"Why couldn't we drive it out?\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He replied, \"This kind can come out only by prayer. \" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, \"The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, \"What were you arguing about on the road?\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, \"If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> \"Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" said John, \"we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Do not stop him,\" Jesus said. \"No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> for whoever is not against us is for us. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> where \"'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.' <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Everyone will be salted with fire. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> \"Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other.\" "},{"_id":"616a0904bda5ba8d737089a9","topicId":"616a0902bda5ba8d737089a1","verse":"Mark 3:1-35","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p41003001_07-8\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v41003001-1\">3:1&nbsp;</b>Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41003002-1\">2&nbsp;</b>And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41003003-1\">3&nbsp;</b>And he said to the man with the withered hand, <span class=\"woc\">“Come here.”</span> <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41003004-1\">4&nbsp;</b>And he said to them, <span class=\"woc\">“Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?”</span> But they were silent. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41003005-1\">5&nbsp;</b>And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, <span class=\"woc\">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41003006-1\">6&nbsp;</b>The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him.</p>\n\n<p id=\"p41003006_12-8\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41003007-1\">7&nbsp;</b>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v41003008-1\">8&nbsp;</b>and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon.

But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!  <strong>25</strong> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.  <strong>26</strong> And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved?  <strong>27</strong> And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible.  <strong>28</strong> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.  <strong>29</strong> And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel’s,  <strong>30</strong> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.  <strong>31</strong> But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. <strong>32</strong> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him,  <strong>33</strong> Saying,Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles:  <strong>34</strong> And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. <strong>35</strong> And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire.  <strong>36</strong> And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?  <strong>37</strong> They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.  <strong>38</strong> But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?  <strong>39</strong> And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:  <strong>40</strong> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.  <strong>41</strong> And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John.  <strong>42</strong> But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them.  <strong>43</strong> But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:  <strong>44</strong> And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.  <strong>45</strong> For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. <strong>46</strong> And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.  <strong>47</strong> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>48</strong> And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.  <strong>49</strong> And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.  <strong>50</strong> And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.  <strong>51</strong> And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.  <strong>52</strong> And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"What did Moses command you?\" he replied. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They said, \"Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.' <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He answered, \"Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, \"Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. \"Good teacher,\" he asked, \"what must I do to inherit eternal life?\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Why do you call me good?\" Jesus answered. \"No one is good--except God alone. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Teacher,\" he declared, \"all these I have kept since I was a boy.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Jesus looked at him and loved him. \"One thing you lack,\" he said. \"Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, \"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, \"Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, \"Who then can be saved?\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Jesus looked at them and said, \"With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Peter said to him, \"We have left everything to follow you!\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus replied, \"no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"We are going up to Jerusalem,\" he said, \"and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"we want you to do for us whatever we ask.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" he asked. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They replied, \"Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"You don't know what you are asking,\" Jesus said. \"Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"We can,\" they answered. Jesus said to them, \"You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Jesus called them together and said, \"You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, \"Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, \"Son of David, have mercy on me!\" <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Jesus stopped and said, \"Call him.\" So they called to the blind man, \"Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> \"What do you want me to do for you?\" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, \"Rabbi, I want to see.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> \"Go,\" said Jesus, \"your faith has healed you.\" Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.

And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.  <strong>30</strong> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.  <strong>31</strong> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.  <strong>32</strong> And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.  <strong>33</strong> But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men. <strong>34</strong>           And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  <strong>35</strong> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.  <strong>36</strong> For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?  <strong>37</strong> Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  <strong>38</strong> Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.

And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.  <strong>5</strong> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?  <strong>6</strong> He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their  lips, but their heart is far from me.  <strong>7</strong> Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.  <strong>8</strong> For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.  <strong>9</strong> And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.  <strong>10</strong> For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:  <strong>11</strong> But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is  Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.  <strong>12</strong> And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;  <strong>13</strong> Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. <strong>14</strong> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:  <strong>15</strong> There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.  <strong>16</strong> If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.  <strong>17</strong> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.  <strong>18</strong> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?

He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"First let the children eat all they want,\" he told her, \"for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> \"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, \"but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then he told her, \"For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, \"Ephphatha!\" (which means, \"Be opened!\" ). <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone.

And they were offended at him.  <strong>4</strong> But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.  <strong>5</strong> And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.  <strong>6</strong> And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.  <strong>7</strong> And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;  <strong>8</strong> And commanded them that they should take nothing for their  journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their  purse:  <strong>9</strong> But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.  <strong>10</strong> And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house, there abide till ye depart from that place.  <strong>11</strong> And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.  <strong>12</strong> And they went out, and preached that men should repent.  <strong>13</strong> And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.  <strong>14</strong> And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.  <strong>15</strong> Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.  <strong>16</strong> But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.  <strong>17</strong> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had married her.  <strong>18</strong> For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.  <strong>19</strong> Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not:  <strong>20</strong> For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.  <strong>21</strong> And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;  <strong>22</strong> And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.  <strong>23</strong> And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.  <strong>24</strong> And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.  <strong>25</strong> And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist.  <strong>26</strong> And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.  <strong>27</strong> And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,  <strong>28</strong> And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother.  <strong>29</strong> And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.  <strong>30</strong> And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.  <strong>31</strong> And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.  <strong>32</strong> And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.  <strong>33</strong> And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto him.  <strong>34</strong> And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.  <strong>35</strong> And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:  <strong>36</strong> Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to eat.  <strong>37</strong> He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?  <strong>38</strong> He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.  <strong>39</strong> And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.  <strong>40</strong> And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.  <strong>41</strong> And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.  <strong>42</strong> And they did all eat, and were filled.  <strong>43</strong> And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the fishes.  <strong>44</strong> And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.  <strong>45</strong> And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.  <strong>46</strong> And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.  <strong>47</strong> And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.  <strong>48</strong> And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.  <strong>49</strong> But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:  <strong>50</strong> For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.  <strong>51</strong> And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.  <strong>52</strong> For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.  <strong>53</strong> And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.  <strong>54</strong> And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him,  <strong>55</strong> And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.  <strong>56</strong> And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> \"Where did this man get these things?\" they asked. \"What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles! Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?\" And they took offense at him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Jesus said to them, \"Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> And he was amazed at their lack of faith. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> These were his instructions: \"Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Wear sandals but not an extra tunic. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> They went out and preached that people should repent. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And still others claimed, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But when Herod heard this, he said, \"John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The king said to the girl, \"Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.\" And he promised her with an oath, \"Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?The head of John the Baptist,\" she answered. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: \"I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, \"Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. \"This is a remote place,\" they said, \"and it's already very late. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But he answered, \"You give them something to eat.\" They said to him, \"That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"How many loaves do you have?\" he asked. \"Go and see.\" When they found out, they said, \"Five--and two fish.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> They all ate and were satisfied, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> because they all saw him and were terrified. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Immediately he spoke to them and said, \"Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.\" Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.

It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Jesus said, \"He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He told them, \"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> so that, \"'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to them, \"Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The farmer sows the word. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown.

Instead, don't you put it on its stand? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Consider carefully what you hear,\" he continued. \"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> He also said, \"This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Again he said, \"What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, \"Let us go over to the other side.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion.

Who can forgive sins but God alone?\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, \"Why are you thinking these things? <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'? <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....\" He said to the paralytic, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all.

A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. \"Follow me,\" Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and \"sinners\" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the \"sinners\" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> On hearing this, Jesus said to them, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, \"How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus answered, \"How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment.

No, he pours new wine into new wineskins.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The Pharisees said to him, \"Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> He answered, \"Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat.

That is why I have come.\" <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, \"If you are willing, you can make me clean.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. \"I am willing,\" he said. \"Be clean!\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> \"See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.\" <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

And they that were crucified with him reviled him.  <strong>33</strong> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.  <strong>34</strong> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  <strong>35</strong> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.  <strong>36</strong> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it  on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.  <strong>37</strong> And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.  <strong>38</strong> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.  <strong>39</strong> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.  <strong>40</strong> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;  <strong>41</strong> (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.  <strong>42</strong> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,  <strong>43</strong> Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.  <strong>44</strong> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him  the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.  <strong>45</strong> And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.  <strong>46</strong> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.  <strong>47</strong> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate. \"Yes, it is as you say,\" Jesus replied. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The chief priests accused him of many things. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So again Pilate asked him, \"Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> \"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?\" asked Pilate, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> \"What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?\" Pilate asked them. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Crucify him!\" they shouted. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> \"Why? What crime has he committed?\" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, \"Crucify him!\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> And they began to call out to him, \"Hail, king of the Jews!\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull). <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> It was the third hour when they crucified him. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, \"So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> come down from the cross and save yourself!\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. \"He saved others,\" they said, \"but he can't save himself! <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\" Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?\"--which means, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> When some of those standing near heard this, they said, \"Listen, he's calling Elijah.\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. \"Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down,\" he said. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, \"Surely this man was the Son of God!\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?  <strong>5</strong> And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man  deceive you:  <strong>6</strong> For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.  <strong>7</strong> And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.  <strong>8</strong> For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.  <strong>9</strong>           But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.  <strong>10</strong> And the gospel must first be published among all nations.  <strong>11</strong> But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.  <strong>12</strong> Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.  <strong>13</strong> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.  <strong>14</strong>           But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:  <strong>15</strong> And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:  <strong>16</strong> And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.  <strong>17</strong> But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!  <strong>18</strong> And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.  <strong>19</strong> For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.  <strong>20</strong> And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.  <strong>21</strong> And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him  not:  <strong>22</strong> For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.  <strong>23</strong> But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things. <strong>24</strong>           But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,  <strong>25</strong> And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.  <strong>26</strong> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.  <strong>27</strong> And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.  <strong>28</strong> Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:  <strong>29</strong> So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.  <strong>30</strong> Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.  <strong>31</strong> Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.  <strong>32</strong>           But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.  <strong>33</strong> Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.  <strong>34</strong> For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.  <strong>35</strong> Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:  <strong>36</strong> Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.  <strong>37</strong> And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.

And they went out to see what it was that was done.  <strong>15</strong> And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.  <strong>16</strong> And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.  <strong>17</strong> And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.  <strong>18</strong> And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.  <strong>19</strong> Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.  <strong>20</strong> And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.  <strong>21</strong> And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.  <strong>22</strong> And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,  <strong>23</strong> And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.  <strong>24</strong> And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.  <strong>25</strong> And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,  <strong>26</strong> And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,  <strong>27</strong> When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment.  <strong>28</strong> For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.  <strong>29</strong> And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.  <strong>30</strong> And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?  <strong>31</strong> And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?  <strong>32</strong> And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.  <strong>33</strong> But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.  <strong>34</strong> And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.  <strong>35</strong> While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?  <strong>36</strong> As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.  <strong>37</strong> And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.  <strong>38</strong> And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.  <strong>39</strong> And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.  <strong>40</strong> And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.  <strong>41</strong> And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.  <strong>42</strong> And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.  <strong>43</strong> And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> He shouted at the top of his voice, \"What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> For Jesus had said to him, \"Come out of this man, you evil spirit!\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Jesus asked him, \"What is your name?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> \"My name is Legion,\" he replied, \"for we are many.\" And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The demons begged Jesus, \"Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Jesus did not let him, but said, \"Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and pleaded earnestly with him, \"My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> So Jesus went with him. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> A large crowd followed and pressed around him. And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> because she thought, \"If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, \"Who touched my clothes?\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"You see the people crowding against you,\" his disciples answered, \"and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.\" <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. \"Your daughter is dead,\" they said. \"Why bother the teacher any more?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, \"Don't be afraid; just believe.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> He went in and said to them, \"Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But they laughed at him. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, \"Talitha koum!\" (which means, \"Little girl, I say to you, get up!\" ). <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat. "}]}
