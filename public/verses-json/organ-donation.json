Farewell. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> See Footnote <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, \"Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
