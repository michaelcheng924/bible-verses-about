and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?  <strong>3</strong> Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.  <strong>4</strong> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:  <strong>5</strong> Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  <strong>6</strong> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.  <strong>7</strong> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.  <strong>8</strong> Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.  <strong>9</strong> Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.  <strong>10</strong> Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.  <strong>11</strong> The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.  <strong>12</strong> She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.  <strong>13</strong> She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.  <strong>14</strong> She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.  <strong>15</strong> She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.  <strong>16</strong> She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.  <strong>17</strong> She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.  <strong>18</strong> She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.  <strong>19</strong> She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.  <strong>20</strong> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.  <strong>21</strong> She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.  <strong>22</strong> She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is  silk and purple.  <strong>23</strong> Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.  <strong>24</strong> She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  <strong>25</strong> Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.  <strong>26</strong> She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.  <strong>27</strong> She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.  <strong>28</strong> Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,  and he praiseth her.  <strong>29</strong> Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.  <strong>30</strong> Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but  a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.  <strong>31</strong> Give her of

She is worth far more than rubies. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.

Treat younger men as brothers, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Give the people these instructions, too, so that no one may be open to blame. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For the Scripture says, \"Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain,\" and \"The worker deserves his wages.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The sins of some men are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden.
