He that loveth his wife loveth himself.  <strong>29</strong> For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:  <strong>30</strong> For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  <strong>31</strong> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.  <strong>32</strong> This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.  <strong>33</strong> Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.

He who loves his wife loves himself. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church-- <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> for we are members of his body. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
