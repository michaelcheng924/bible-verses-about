Do not use any iron tool upon them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Build the altar of the LORD your God with fieldstones and offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Sacrifice fellowship offerings there, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Moses and the priests, who are Levites, said to all Israel, \"Be silent, O Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the LORD your God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Obey the LORD your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> On the same day Moses commanded the people: <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice: <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol-a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of the craftsman's hands-and sets it up in secret.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbor's boundary stone.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the road.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his father's wife, for he dishonors his father's bed.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who has sexual relations with any animal.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who sleeps with his mother-in-law.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbor secretly.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out.\" Then all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" "}]}
