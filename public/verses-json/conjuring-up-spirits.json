And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:  <strong>2</strong> And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  <strong>3</strong> And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.  <strong>4</strong> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  <strong>5</strong> But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.  <strong>6</strong> He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.  <strong>7</strong> Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.  <strong>8</strong> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.  <strong>9</strong> He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.  <strong>10</strong> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.  <strong>11</strong> But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.  <strong>12</strong> I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.  <strong>13</strong> I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is  from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.  <strong>14</strong> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.  <strong>15</strong> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  <strong>16</strong> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  <strong>17</strong> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.  <strong>18</strong> Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.  <strong>19</strong> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.  <strong>20</strong> But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.  <strong>21</strong> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.  <strong>22</strong> Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.  <strong>23</strong> Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.  <strong>24</strong> Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.  <strong>25</strong> And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.  <strong>26</strong> These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.  <strong>27</strong> But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.  <strong>28</strong> And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.  <strong>29</strong> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.

But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.

This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

And they went to Moab and lived there. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \"Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.\" Then she kissed them and they wept aloud <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> and said to her, \"We will go back with you to your people.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But Naomi said, \"Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me-even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons- <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"Look,\" said Naomi, \"your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> But Ruth replied, \"Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, \"Can this be Naomi?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"Don't call me Naomi, \"she told them. \"Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty.
