In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When tempted, no one should say, \"God is tempting me.\" For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Don't be deceived, my dear brothers. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> My dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.  <strong>3</strong> Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with  all my ways.  <strong>4</strong> For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.  <strong>5</strong> Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.  <strong>6</strong>             Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.  <strong>7</strong> Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?  <strong>8</strong> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. <strong>9</strong>             If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;

<strong>12</strong> Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.  <strong>13</strong> For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.  <strong>14</strong> I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.  <strong>15</strong> My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.  <strong>16</strong> Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.  <strong>17</strong> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!  <strong>18</strong>             If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.  <strong>19</strong> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.  <strong>20</strong> For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.  <strong>21</strong> Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?  <strong>22</strong> I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
