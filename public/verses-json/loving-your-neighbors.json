I removed the boundaries of nations, I plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued their kings. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> As one reaches into a nest, so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations; as men gather abandoned eggs, so I gathered all the countries; not one flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to chirp.'\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Does the ax raise itself above him who swings it, or the saw boast against him who uses it? As if a rod were to wield him who lifts it up, or a club brandish him who is not wood! <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Therefore, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors; under his pomp a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The Light of Israel will become a fire, their Holy One a flame; in a single day it will burn and consume his thorns and his briers. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The splendor of his forests and fertile fields it will completely destroy, as when a sick man wastes away. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few that a child could write them down. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> In that day the remnant of Israel, the survivors of the house of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overwhelming and righteous. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The Lord, the LORD Almighty, will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore, this is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says: \"O my people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians, who beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you, as Egypt did. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty will lash them with a whip, as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb; and he will raise his staff over the waters, as he did in Egypt. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> In that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders, their yoke from your neck; the yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> They enter Aiath; they pass through Migron; they store supplies at Micmash. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They go over the pass, and say, \"We will camp overnight at Geba.\" Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Cry out, O Daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! Poor Anathoth! <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Madmenah is in flight; the people of Gebim take cover. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> This day they will halt at Nob; they will shake their fist at the mount of the Daughter of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> See, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will lop off the boughs with great power. The lofty trees will be felled, the tall ones will be brought low. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> He will cut down the forest thickets with an ax; Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.

<strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.

calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with

And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  <strong>2</strong> And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:  <strong>3</strong> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  <strong>4</strong> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  <strong>5</strong> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  <strong>6</strong> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.  <strong>7</strong> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.  <strong>8</strong> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.  <strong>9</strong> And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art  thou?  <strong>10</strong> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.  <strong>11</strong> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?  <strong>12</strong> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  <strong>13</strong> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that  thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  <strong>14</strong> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  <strong>15</strong> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.  <strong>16</strong> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  <strong>17</strong> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;  <strong>18</strong> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;  <strong>19</strong> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.  <strong>20</strong> And Adam called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.  <strong>21</strong> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.  <strong>22</strong> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:  <strong>23</strong> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  <strong>24</strong> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But the LORD God called to the man, \"Where are you?\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> He answered, \"I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> And he said, \"Who told you that you were naked?

Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.\" <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> To Adam he said, \"Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,'\"Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> And the LORD God said, \"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
