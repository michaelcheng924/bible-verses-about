Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <strong>2</strong> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.  <strong>3</strong> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but  Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.  <strong>4</strong> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.  <strong>5</strong> Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.  <strong>6</strong> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.  <strong>7</strong> Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.  <strong>8</strong> And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.  <strong>9</strong> Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.  <strong>10</strong> Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.  <strong>11</strong> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.  <strong>12</strong> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I

They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me.

Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot!

They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"616b1178c1af50acf0bc8fe0","topicId":"616b1174c1af50acf0bc8fd7","verse":"John 15:1-27","votes":16,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p43015001_06-12\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v43015001-1\">15:1&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43015002-1\">2&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43015003-1\">3&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.</span> <b class=\"verse-num woc\" id=\"v43015004-1\">4&nbsp;</b><span class=\"woc\">Abide in me, and I in you.
