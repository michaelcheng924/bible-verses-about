I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants-me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"You are welcome at my house,\" the old man said. \"Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, \"Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The owner of the house went outside and said to them, \"No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He said to her, \"Get up; let's go.\" But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Everyone who saw it said, \"Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!\" "},{"_id":"61676a366451fe5325fa0c61","topicId":"61676a336451fe5325fa0c56","verse":"3 John 1:9-10","votes":3,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p64001001_02-14\" class=\"starts-chapter\"><b class=\"chapter-num\" id=\"v64001001-1\">1:1&nbsp;</b>The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>9</strong> I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.  <strong>10</strong> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.

See, I have commanded you.  <strong>9</strong> Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.  <strong>10</strong> And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.  <strong>11</strong> And all the people, even the people of war that were  with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.  <strong>12</strong> And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.  <strong>13</strong> And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.  <strong>14</strong> And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city.  <strong>15</strong> And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.  <strong>16</strong> And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.  <strong>17</strong> And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.  <strong>18</strong> And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is  in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.  <strong>19</strong> And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.  <strong>20</strong> And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.  <strong>21</strong> And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.  <strong>22</strong> And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.  <strong>23</strong> And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.  <strong>24</strong> And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.  <strong>25</strong> And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.  <strong>26</strong> For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.  <strong>27</strong> Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.  <strong>28</strong> And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation unto this day.  <strong>29</strong> And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.  <strong>30</strong> Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal,  <strong>31</strong> As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.  <strong>32</strong> And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.  <strong>33</strong> And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.  <strong>34</strong> And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.  <strong>35</strong> There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.\" <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> with these orders: \"Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don't go very far from it. All of you be on the alert. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are running away from us as they did before.' So when we flee from them, <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The LORD your God will give it into your hand. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the LORD has commanded. See to it; you have my orders.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai-but Joshua spent that night with the people. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> They had the soldiers take up their positions-all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the desert. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city.\" So Joshua held out his javelin toward Ai. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction, for the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The men of the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Twelve thousand men and women fell that day-all the people of Ai. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the LORD had instructed Joshua. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> He hung the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses-an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the LORD burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua copied on stones the law of Moses, which he had written. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> All Israel, aliens and citizens alike, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD, facing those who carried it-the priests, who were Levites. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law-the blessings and the curses-just as it is written in the Book of the Law. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the aliens who lived among them.

Then the Israelites said, \"Tell us how this awful thing happened.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, \"I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel's inheritance, because they committed this lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now, all you Israelites, speak up and give your verdict.\" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> All the people rose as one man, saying, \"None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But now this is what we'll do to Gibeah: We'll go up against it as the lot directs. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for all this vileness done in Israel.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> So all the men of Israel got together and united as one man against the city. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, \"What about this awful crime that was committed among you? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now surrender those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.\" But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred chosen men from those living in Gibeah. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fighting men. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They said, \"Who of us shall go first to fight against the Benjamites?\" The LORD replied, \"Judah shall go first.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The men of Israel went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> But the men of Israel encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and they inquired of the LORD. They said, \"Shall we go up again to battle against the Benjamites, our brothers?\" The LORD answered, \"Go up against them.\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the LORD. They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> And the Israelites inquired of the LORD. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there, <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, \"Shall we go up again to battle with Benjamin our brother, or not?\" The LORD responded, \"Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads-the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> While the Benjamites were saying, \"We are defeating them as before,\" the Israelites were saying, \"Let's retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west of Gibeah. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Then ten thousand of Israel's finest men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city, <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> and then the men of Israel would turn in the battle. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of Israel (about thirty), and they said, \"We are defeating them as in the first battle.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> As they turned and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> But six hundred men turned and fled into the desert to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.

On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018013-1\">13&nbsp;</b>And they passed on from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.</p>\n<p id=\"p07018013_08-25\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018014-1\">14&nbsp;</b>Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, “Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a metal image? Now therefore consider what you will do.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018015-1\">15&nbsp;</b>And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him about his welfare. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018016-1\">16&nbsp;</b>Now the 600 men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018017-1\">17&nbsp;</b>And the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war. <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018018-1\">18&nbsp;</b>And when these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018019-1\">19&nbsp;</b>And they said to him, “Keep quiet; put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018020-1\">20&nbsp;</b>And the priest’s heart was glad.

How then do you ask me, ‘What is the matter with you?’” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018025-1\">25&nbsp;</b>And the people of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household.” <b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v07018026-1\">26&nbsp;</b>Then the people of Dan went their way.

Then said the priest unto them, What do ye?  <strong>19</strong> And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?  <strong>20</strong> And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.  <strong>21</strong> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.  <strong>22</strong>           And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.  <strong>23</strong> And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?  <strong>24</strong> And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?  <strong>25</strong> And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.  <strong>26</strong> And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.  <strong>27</strong> And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.  <strong>28</strong> And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.  <strong>29</strong> And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was  Laish at the first.  <strong>30</strong> And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.  <strong>31</strong> And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them, \"Go, explore the land.\" The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, \"Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, \"He has hired me and I am his priest.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Then they said to him, \"Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> The priest answered them, \"Go in peace. Your journey has the LORD 's approval.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, unsuspecting and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, \"How did you find things?\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> They answered, \"Come on, let's attack them! We have seen that the land is very good. Aren't you going to do something? Don't hesitate to go there and take it over. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever.\" <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Then six hundred men from the clan of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their brothers, \"Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, other household gods, a carved image and a cast idol? Now you know what to do.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah's place and greeted him. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance to the gate. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When these men went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol, the priest said to them, \"What are you doing?\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They answered him, \"Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When they had gone some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, \"What's the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He replied, \"You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?'\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> The Danites answered, \"Don't argue with us, or some hot-tempered men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> They named it Dan after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel-though the city used to be called Laish. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> They continued to use the idols Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
