This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> But there is a place where someone has testified: \"What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him? <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and put everything under his feet.? In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him.
