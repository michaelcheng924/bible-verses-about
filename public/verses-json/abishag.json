And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.  <strong>14</strong> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.  <strong>15</strong> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that  all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.  <strong>16</strong> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.  <strong>17</strong> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.  <strong>18</strong> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.  <strong>19</strong> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.  <strong>20</strong> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,  say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.  <strong>21</strong> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.  <strong>22</strong> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.  <strong>23</strong> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.  <strong>24</strong> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.  <strong>25</strong> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.  <strong>26</strong> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.  <strong>27</strong> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.  <strong>28</strong> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.  <strong>29</strong> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.  <strong>30</strong> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.  <strong>31</strong> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.  <strong>32</strong> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.  <strong>33</strong> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD.  <strong>34</strong> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.  <strong>35</strong> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.  <strong>36</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither.  <strong>37</strong> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.  <strong>38</strong> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.  <strong>39</strong> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.  <strong>40</strong> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.  <strong>41</strong> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.  <strong>42</strong> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.  <strong>43</strong> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?  <strong>44</strong> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;  <strong>45</strong> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever.  <strong>46</strong> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"I am about to go the way of all the earth,\" he said. \"So be strong, show yourself a man, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> and observe what the LORD your God requires: Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> and that the LORD may keep his promise to me: 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.' <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> \"Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me-what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD: 'I will not put you to death by the sword.' <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.\" <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He had reigned forty years over Israel-seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, \"Do you come peacefully?\" He answered, \"Yes, peacefully.\" <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Then he added, \"I have something to say to you.You may say it,\" she replied. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> \"As you know,\" he said, \"the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.You may make it,\" she said. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> So he continued, \"Please ask King Solomon-he will not refuse you-to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Very well,\" Bathsheba replied, \"I will speak to the king for you.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"I have one small request to make of you,\" she said. \"Do not refuse me.\" The king replied, \"Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.\" <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> So she said, \"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> King Solomon answered his mother, \"Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him-after all, he is my older brother-yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then King Solomon swore by the LORD: \"May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request! <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And now, as surely as the LORD lives-he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised-Adonijah shall be put to death today!\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> To Abiathar the priest the king said, \"Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, \"Go, strike him down!\" <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, \"The king says, 'Come out!'\" But he answered, \"No, I will die here.\" Benaiah reported to the king, \"This is how Joab answered me.\" <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Then the king commanded Benaiah, \"Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them-Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army-were better men and more upright than he. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD's peace forever.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land in the desert. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, \"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.\" <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> Shimei answered the king, \"What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.\" And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, \"Your slaves are in Gath.\" <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> the king summoned Shimei and said to him, \"Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.' <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> The king also said to Shimei, \"You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wrongdoing. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the LORD forever.\" <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and killed him.

On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, \"What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, \"Come in.

He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> Solomon replied, \"If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die.\" <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar.

How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate.\" <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. \"Is the child dead?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" they replied, \"he is dead.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped.

I thought, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again?

 <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.  <strong>27</strong> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.  <strong>28</strong> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.  <strong>29</strong> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.  <strong>30</strong> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.  <strong>31</strong> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" ","esv":"<div>\n\n<p id=\"p23001001_01-4\"

O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: \"It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?\" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The LORD says, \"The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> the earrings and bracelets and veils, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> the signet rings and nose rings, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
