 <strong>15</strong> And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.  <strong>16</strong> And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:  <strong>17</strong> And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?  <strong>18</strong> And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.  <strong>19</strong> And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.  <strong>20</strong> But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?  <strong>21</strong> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. <strong>22</strong> And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.  <strong>23</strong> The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.  <strong>24</strong> Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?

 <strong>29</strong> And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.  <strong>30</strong> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. <strong>31</strong>           But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.  <strong>32</strong> Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.  <strong>33</strong> Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.  <strong>34</strong> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.  <strong>35</strong> Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;  <strong>36</strong> And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.  <strong>37</strong> Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.  <strong>38</strong> And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.  <strong>39</strong> And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.  <strong>40</strong> Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not. <strong>41</strong> Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?

For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more. <strong>49</strong>           I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?  <strong>50</strong> But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!  <strong>51</strong> Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth?

Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.\" <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> And he told them this parable: \"The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.' <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And I'll say to myself, \"You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.\"' <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> \"But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?' <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> \"This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God.\" <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Then Jesus said to his disciples: \"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds! <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest? <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Consider how the lilies grow.

Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> \"Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.\" <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Peter asked, \"Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> The Lord answered, \"Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time? <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.

And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:  <strong>18</strong> I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.  <strong>19</strong>           Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;  <strong>20</strong> The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> who testifies to everything he saw--that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood, and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> \"I am the Alpha and the Omega,\" says the Lord God, \"who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> which said: \"Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.\" <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands, <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> and among the lampstands was someone \"like a son of man,\" dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said: \"Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> \"Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
