All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, \"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Greet one another with a kiss of love.
