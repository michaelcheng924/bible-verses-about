Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.  <strong>28</strong> Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again  unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.  <strong>29</strong> And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.  <strong>30</strong> Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.  <strong>31</strong> But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.
