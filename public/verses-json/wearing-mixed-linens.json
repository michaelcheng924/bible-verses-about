But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.

This is how we know it is the last hour. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.  <strong>18</strong> Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.  <strong>19</strong> For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.  <strong>20</strong> For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it,  ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.  <strong>21</strong> For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:  <strong>22</strong> Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:  <strong>23</strong> Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:  <strong>24</strong> Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.  <strong>25</strong> For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation, <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> now that you have tasted that the Lord is good. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him-- <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For in Scripture it says: \"See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, \"The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone, \" <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and, \"A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall.\" They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men: whether to the king, as the supreme authority, <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Show proper respect to everyone: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.\" <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
