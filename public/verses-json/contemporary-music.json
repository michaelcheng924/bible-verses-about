 <strong>14</strong> But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye:  and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;  <strong>15</strong> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:  <strong>16</strong> Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.  <strong>17</strong> For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.  <strong>18</strong> For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:  <strong>19</strong> By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;  <strong>20</strong> Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.  <strong>21</strong> The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:  <strong>22</strong> Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.  <strong>1</strong> Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;  <strong>2</strong> That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.  <strong>3</strong> For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:  <strong>4</strong> Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:  <strong>5</strong> Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.  <strong>6</strong> For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.  <strong>7</strong> But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.  <strong>8</strong> And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.  <strong>9</strong> Use hospitality one to another without grudging.  <strong>10</strong> As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.  <strong>11</strong> If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.

For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape,  if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:  <strong>26</strong> Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.  <strong>27</strong> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.  <strong>28</strong> Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:  <strong>29</strong> For our God is a consuming fire.  <strong>1</strong> Let brotherly love continue.  <strong>2</strong> Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.  <strong>3</strong> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.  <strong>4</strong> Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.  <strong>5</strong> Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  <strong>6</strong> So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.  <strong>7</strong> Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.  <strong>8</strong> Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.  <strong>9</strong> Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is  a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.  <strong>10</strong> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.  <strong>11</strong> For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.  <strong>12</strong> Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.  <strong>13</strong> Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.  <strong>14</strong> For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.  <strong>15</strong> By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.  <strong>16</strong> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.  <strong>17</strong> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.  <strong>18</strong> Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.  <strong>19</strong> But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.  <strong>20</strong> Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,  <strong>21</strong> Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be  glory for ever and ever. Amen.  <strong>22</strong> And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.  <strong>23</strong> Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.  <strong>24</strong> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.  <strong>25</strong> Grace be with you all. Amen.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons: \"My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.\" <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> \"Make level paths for your feet,\" so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.

The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> \"Look,\" says the Teacher, \"this is what I have discovered: \"Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things- <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> while I was still searching but not finding- I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> This only have I found: God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes.\" "},{"_id":"615ba5bd7d79181a31670f8a","topicId":"615ba5b77d79181a31670f75","verse":"Ecclesiastes 1:1-2:26","votes":2,"__v":0,"kjv":"<strong>1</strong> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.  <strong>2</strong> Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.  <strong>3</strong> What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?  <strong>4</strong> One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.  <strong>5</strong> The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.  <strong>6</strong> The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.  <strong>7</strong> All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.  <strong>8</strong> All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it:  the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.  <strong>9</strong> The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is  no new thing under the sun.  <strong>10</strong> Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.  <strong>11</strong> There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.  <strong>12</strong> I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.  <strong>13</strong> And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.  <strong>14</strong> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.  <strong>15</strong> That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.  <strong>16</strong> I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.  <strong>17</strong> And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.  <strong>18</strong> For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.  <strong>1</strong> I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.  <strong>2</strong> I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?  <strong>3</strong> I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was  that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.  <strong>4</strong> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards:  <strong>5</strong> I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:  <strong>6</strong> I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:  <strong>7</strong> I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:  <strong>8</strong> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.  <strong>9</strong> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.  <strong>10</strong> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.  <strong>11</strong> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.  <strong>12</strong> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even  that which hath been already done.  <strong>13</strong> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.  <strong>14</strong> The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.  <strong>15</strong> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.  <strong>16</strong> For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.  <strong>17</strong> Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.  <strong>18</strong> Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.  <strong>19</strong> And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.  <strong>20</strong> Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.  <strong>21</strong> For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.  <strong>22</strong> For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?  <strong>23</strong> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.  <strong>24</strong>           There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.  <strong>25</strong> For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?  <strong>26</strong> For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> \"Meaningless!
