And the final condition of that man is worse than the first.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, \"Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> He replied, \"Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it.\" <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> As the crowds increased, Jesus said, \"This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> \"No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl.

When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you.\" <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Then the Lord said to him, \"Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also? <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> But give what is inside the dish to the poor, and everything will be clean for you. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God.

if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  <strong>13</strong> And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.  <strong>14</strong> Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish. <strong>15</strong>           Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.  <strong>16</strong> But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  <strong>17</strong> And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  <strong>18</strong> Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  <strong>19</strong> Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  <strong>20</strong> For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. <strong>21</strong> Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?
