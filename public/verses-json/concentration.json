He testified concerning him: 'I have found David son of Jesse a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.' <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> As John was completing his work, he said: 'Who do you think I am? I am not that one. No, but he is coming after me, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.' <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> \"Brothers, children of Abraham, and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> But God raised him from the dead, <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> \"We tell you the good news: What God promised our fathers <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: \"'You are my Son; today I have become your Father. ' <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> The fact that God raised him from the dead, never to decay, is stated in these words: \"'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.' <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> So it is stated elsewhere: \"'You will not let your Holy One see decay.' <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> \"For when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> \"Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you: <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> \"'Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.'\" <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God. <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and talked abusively against what Paul was saying. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: \"We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> For this is what the Lord has commanded us: \"'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'\" <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> The word of the Lord spread through the whole region. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium. <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
