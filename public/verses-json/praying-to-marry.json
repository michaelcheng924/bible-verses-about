They were submissive to their own husbands, <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> For, \"Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He must turn from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.\" <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good? <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. \"Do not fear what they fear; do not be frightened.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.

to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?  <strong>13</strong> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is  iniquity, even the solemn meeting.  <strong>14</strong> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.  <strong>15</strong> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.  <strong>16</strong> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;  <strong>17</strong> Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.  <strong>18</strong> Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <strong>19</strong> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:  <strong>20</strong> But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it. <strong>21</strong> How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.  <strong>22</strong> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:  <strong>23</strong> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.  <strong>24</strong> Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:  <strong>25</strong> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:  <strong>26</strong> And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.  <strong>27</strong> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.  <strong>28</strong> And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.  <strong>29</strong> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.  <strong>30</strong> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.  <strong>31</strong> And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken: \"I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand.\" <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness- only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah! <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> \"The multitude of your sacrifices- what are they to me?\" says the LORD. \"I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations- I cannot bear your evil assemblies. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood; <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong, <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Come now, let us reason together,\" says the LORD. \"Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.\" For the mouth of the LORD has spoken. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her- but now murderers! <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: \"Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.\" <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> \"You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire.\" "},{"_id":"61697deabda5ba8d73708660","topicId":"61697de3bda5ba8d7370864a","verse":"Genesis 1:27","votes":2,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p class=\"block-indent\"><span class=\"begin-line-group\"></span>\n<span id=\"p01001027_01-22\" class=\"line\"><b class=\"verse-num inline\" id=\"v01001027-1\">27&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;So God created man in his own image,</span><br><span id=\"p01001027_01-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the image of God he created him;</span><br><span id=\"p01001027_01-22\" class=\"indent line\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;male and female he created them.</span><br></p><span class=\"end-line-group\"></span>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

And he said, Speak on.  <strong>34</strong> And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.  <strong>35</strong> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.  <strong>36</strong> And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.  <strong>37</strong> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:  <strong>38</strong> But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son.  <strong>39</strong> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.  <strong>40</strong> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:  <strong>41</strong> Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.  <strong>42</strong> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go;  <strong>43</strong> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;  <strong>44</strong> And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son.  <strong>45</strong> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.  <strong>46</strong> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,  and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.  <strong>47</strong> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.  <strong>48</strong> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.  <strong>49</strong> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.  <strong>50</strong> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.  <strong>52</strong> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.  <strong>53</strong> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.  <strong>54</strong> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.  <strong>55</strong> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.  <strong>56</strong> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.  <strong>57</strong> And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.  <strong>58</strong> And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.  <strong>59</strong> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.  <strong>60</strong> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.  <strong>61</strong> And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.  <strong>62</strong> And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country.  <strong>63</strong> And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.  <strong>64</strong> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.  <strong>65</strong> For she had said unto the servant, What man is  this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had  said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.  <strong>66</strong> And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.  <strong>67</strong> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death. ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He said to the chief servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, \"Put your hand under my thigh. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac.\" <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> The servant asked him, \"What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?\" <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> \"Make sure that you do not take my son back there,\" Abraham said. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> \"The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land'-he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.\" <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> Then he prayed, \"O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> May it be that when I say to a girl, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too'-let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.\" <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> The servant hurried to meet her and said, \"Please give me a little water from your jar.\" <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> \"Drink, my lord,\" she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> After she had given him a drink, she said, \"I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking.\" <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Then he asked, \"Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?\" <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> She answered him, \"I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.\" <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And she added, \"We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> saying, \"Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives.\" <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> The girl ran and told her mother's household about these things. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> \"Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,\" he said. \"Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.\" <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Then food was set before him, but he said, \"I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.Then tell us,\" Laban said. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> So he said, \"I am Abraham's servant. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, and camels and donkeys. <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> My master's wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> And my master made me swear an oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.' <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> \"Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?' <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> \"He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> Then, when you go to my clan, you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you-you will be released from my oath.' <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> \"When I came to the spring today, I said, 'O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come. <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> See, I am standing beside this spring; if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, \"Please let me drink a little water from your jar,\" <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> and if she says to me, \"Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too,\" let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master's son.' <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> \"Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.' <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> \"She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> \"I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?'\"She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.'\"Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.\" <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> Laban and Bethuel answered, \"This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed.\" <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, \"Send me on my way to my master.\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> But her brother and her mother replied, \"Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; then you may go.\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> But he said to them, \"Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.\" <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> Then they said, \"Let's call the girl and ask her about it.\" <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> So they called Rebekah and asked her, \"Will you go with this man?I will go,\" she said. <sup><strong>59</strong></sup> So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men. <sup><strong>60</strong></sup> And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, \"Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies.\" <sup><strong>61</strong></sup> Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left. <sup><strong>62</strong></sup> Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev. <sup><strong>63</strong></sup> He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching. <sup><strong>64</strong></sup> Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel <sup><strong>65</strong></sup> and asked the servant, \"Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?He is my master,\" the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself. <sup><strong>66</strong></sup> Then the servant told Isaac all he had done. <sup><strong>67</strong></sup> Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
