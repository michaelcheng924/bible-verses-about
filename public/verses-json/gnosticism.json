But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> The man who says, \"I know him,\" but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him: <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning.

For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> And this is what he promised us--even eternal life. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.  <strong>28</strong> And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.  <strong>29</strong> Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?  <strong>30</strong> And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?  <strong>31</strong> I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.  <strong>32</strong> If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  <strong>33</strong> Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.  <strong>34</strong> Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.  <strong>35</strong> But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?  <strong>36</strong> Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:  <strong>37</strong> And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:  <strong>38</strong> But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.  <strong>39</strong> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.  <strong>40</strong> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  <strong>41</strong> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.  <strong>42</strong> So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  <strong>43</strong> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:  <strong>44</strong> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.  <strong>45</strong> And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  <strong>46</strong> Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.  <strong>47</strong> The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.  <strong>48</strong> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  <strong>49</strong> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  <strong>50</strong> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.  <strong>51</strong> Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,  <strong>52</strong> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  <strong>53</strong> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  <strong>54</strong> So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.  <strong>55</strong> O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is  thy victory?  <strong>56</strong> The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is  the law.  <strong>57</strong> But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  <strong>58</strong> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.  ","niv":"<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> The last enemy to be destroyed is death. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For he \"has put everything under his feet.\" Now when it says that \"everything\" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> I die every day--I mean that, brothers--just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, \"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\" <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Do not be misled: \"Bad company corrupts good character.\" <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> But someone may ask, \"How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?\" <sup><strong>36</strong></sup> How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. <sup><strong>39</strong></sup> All flesh is not the same: Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. <sup><strong>42</strong></sup> So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; <sup><strong>43</strong></sup> it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; <sup><strong>44</strong></sup> it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <sup><strong>45</strong></sup> So it is written: \"The first man Adam became a living being\"; the last Adam, a lifegiving spirit. <sup><strong>46</strong></sup> The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. <sup><strong>47</strong></sup> The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. <sup><strong>48</strong></sup> As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. <sup><strong>49</strong></sup> And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven. <sup><strong>50</strong></sup> I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <sup><strong>51</strong></sup> Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed-- <sup><strong>52</strong></sup> in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. <sup><strong>53</strong></sup> For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. <sup><strong>54</strong></sup> When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: \"Death has been swallowed up in victory.\" <sup><strong>55</strong></sup> \"Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?\" <sup><strong>56</strong></sup> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. <sup><strong>57</strong></sup> But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup><strong>58</strong></sup> Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.

Do not touch!\"? <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
