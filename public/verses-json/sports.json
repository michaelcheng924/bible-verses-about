Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. <sup><strong>5</strong></sup> But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. <sup><strong>6</strong></sup> For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure. <sup><strong>7</strong></sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. <sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. <sup><strong>9</strong></sup> Do your best to come to me quickly, <sup><strong>10</strong></sup> for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. <sup><strong>12</strong></sup> I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <sup><strong>13</strong></sup> When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. <sup><strong>14</strong></sup> Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. <sup><strong>15</strong></sup> You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message. <sup><strong>16</strong></sup> At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. <sup><strong>17</strong></sup> But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is  safe.  <strong>2</strong> Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.  <strong>3</strong> For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.  <strong>4</strong> Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:  <strong>5</strong> Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;  <strong>6</strong> Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.  <strong>7</strong> But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.  <strong>8</strong> Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,  <strong>9</strong> And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:  <strong>10</strong> That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;  <strong>11</strong> If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.  <strong>12</strong> Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.  <strong>13</strong> Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this  one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,  <strong>14</strong> I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.  <strong>15</strong> Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.  <strong>16</strong> Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.  <strong>17</strong> Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.  <strong>18</strong> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:  <strong>19</strong> Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)  <strong>20</strong> For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:  <strong>21</strong> Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.
