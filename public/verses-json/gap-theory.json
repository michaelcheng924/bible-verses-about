that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,  <strong>4</strong> That thou shalt take up this proverb against the

Like a corpse trampled underfoot, <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again. <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> \"I will rise up against them,\" declares the LORD Almighty. \"I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors, her offspring and descendants,\" declares the LORD. <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> \"I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,\" declares the LORD Almighty. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> The LORD Almighty has sworn, \"Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand. <sup><strong>25</strong></sup> I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders.\" <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations. <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back? <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died: <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Wail, O gate! Howl, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? \"The LORD has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge.\" "},{"_id":"61621e539b02b3054ca4f25f","topicId":"61621e4d9b02b3054ca4f24d","verse":"Ephesians 6:12","votes":4,"__v":0,"esv":"<div>\n<p id=\"p49006012_01-20\" class=\"virtual\"><b class=\"verse-num\" id=\"v49006012-1\">12&nbsp;</b>For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.</p>\n</div>","kjv":"<strong>12</strong> For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
